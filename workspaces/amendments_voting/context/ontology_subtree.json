DLS Preferred specifies a Required Lenders threshold (>50% of aggregate unused commitments and outstanding loans) for standard amendments, with escalating consent requirements: each directly affected lender for commitment increases, rate/principal reductions, payment date postponements, pro rata sharing/waterfall/priority modifications, and assignment restrictions; 100% lender consent for release of all/substantially all guarantors or collateral, changes to voting thresholds or the amendment section, and amendments permitting sponsor/affiliate term loan purchases. Class voting permits Required Revolving Lenders to amend revolver-only provisions. Agent and borrower can jointly correct obvious errors or technical omissions with notice to lenders.",
