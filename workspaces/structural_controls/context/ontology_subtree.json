Pro rata sharing ensures incremental term loans receive the same proportional share of mandatory prepayments as existing term loans, preventing the existing lenders from being diluted in the prepayment waterfall. Without pro rata sharing, the borrower could direct prepayments exclusively to incremental tranches (or exclusively away from them), distorting the relative amortization profiles.",
