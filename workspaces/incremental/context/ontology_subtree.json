This is the most lender-protective EBITDA basis because it prevents the grower from increasing over time — the fixed dollar floor already provides capacity, and the frozen EBITDA percentage provides a known, non-expanding ceiling. However, it is also the most restrictive for borrowers, as a company that doubles its EBITDA would still have the same percentage-based capacity as at closing. This basis is uncommon in practice because it undermines the core purpose of the grower mechanism (scaling capacity with the business).",

Per PC Term Comparison lines 228-240, Aggressive UMM/BSL deals feature: MFN sunset at 12-18 months (line 229), MFN capped at 50% of EBITDA (line 233), MFN applies only to pari term loans (line 236), and inside maturity exception up to 50-100% of EBITDA (line 249).
