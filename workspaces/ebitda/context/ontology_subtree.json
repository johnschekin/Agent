DLS Preferred row 15 (Limited Condition Acquisition) specifies that testing of Ratios/Baskets/Conditions in connection with an LCA is done at the time of signing, and future testing must be conducted on dual bases: '(i) assuming such LCA has been consummated and counting any related debt incurrence, RP and EBITDA of such acquired business and (ii) on a stand alone non-pro forma basis as if such LCA had not been consummated.' Pro forma EBITDA incorporates target EBITDA, eliminates disposed business EBITDA, and layers on permitted cost savings/synergies, all subject to the same addback caps as regular EBITDA. Review Template row 50 notes that pro formas are 'borrower-prepared' and 'internally prepared pro formas suffice for bank facilities.'",
