Only 0.8% of CAs contain explicit anti-stacking provisions — the near-universal absence of anti-stacking means stacking is the default market position. This is one of the most significant structural features in the debt capacity framework: without anti-stacking, a borrower can combine free-and-clear capacity + ratio capacity + general basket capacity for a single incurrence, maximizing aggregate debt capacity well beyond what any individual basket would permit. Per PC Term Comparison line 407 (liens): 'Avoid having both a general liens basket and a crossing lien to general debt basket' — this is the closest the market comes to an anti-stacking principle, and it addresses only liens-to-debt crossing, not broader stacking.",
