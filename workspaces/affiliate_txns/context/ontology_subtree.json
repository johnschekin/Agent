Key elements include: (1) arm's length/fair value requirements, (2) board approval mechanics, (3) fairness opinion thresholds for material transactions, (4) grandfathering of existing arrangements, and (5) specific carve-outs for operational matters. The approval pyramid typically requires: arm's length terms for all transactions, board approval above a threshold, disinterested director approval above a higher threshold, and fairness opinion for the largest transactions. Grandfathering provisions are particularly important as they preserve pre-existing affiliate relationships but can perpetuate unfavorable arrangements. Amendment limitations on grandfathered arrangements prevent expansion of existing deals.",

Market standard is the Greater of $5-10M and 5-10% of LTM EBITDA measured annually in aggregate. The threshold exists to permit routine, operational transactions without administrative burden while preventing material value leakage to affiliates. Key negotiation points include: (1) whether the threshold is measured per-transaction or in aggregate, (2) whether there is an annual reset or cumulative cap, (3) the arm's length requirement applicability, and (4) carve-outs for ordinary course transactions. Lenders focus on preventing structuring around the threshold through multiple sub-threshold transactions and ensuring fair value requirements apply.",
