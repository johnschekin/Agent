Per PC Term Comparison: 'Stacking/Phony Ratio: Clients will consider excluding concurrent revolver draws but will reject excluding revolver outstandings altogether.

The definition typically covers transactions closing on the same date or as part of a single integrated transaction. Key negotiation point is whether literal simultaneity is required vs. 'substantially concurrent.'",
