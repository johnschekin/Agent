Frequently contains exceptions where participation in the priming debt is offered ratably to all lenders on the same terms. Common weaknesses: (a) blocker does not cover both lien and payment priority; (b) ratable offer exception lacks 'same terms' requirement; (c) carve-out for debt 'as otherwise permitted' not limited to terms as of the closing date; (d) carves out specific types of permitted priming Indebtedness; (e) DIP carve-out without ratable participation on same terms (American Tire loophole). KCT Category 3 item 15 describes the Serta structure as using borrower buyback provisions to effectuate a debt-for-debt exchange creating 'super priority' lenders without affected lender consent. PC Term Comparison: include strong Serta protection; clients will likely accept offer to participate but must include on same terms (including fees).",
