Holidays typically range from 1-2 fiscal years, with 1 year (4 quarters) being most common in the market.

Two common types exist: (1) annual aggregate thresholds that set a yearly ceiling before sweep triggers, and (2) per-transaction thresholds for individual sales. Thresholds often include \"grower\" components tied to EBITDA or Total Assets, allowing the threshold to increase with the company's size. This flexibility helps growing borrowers manage routine asset sales without constant prepayment obligations. The threshold structure significantly impacts borrower flexibility - high thresholds with growers can effectively neutralize the sweep for many mid-market companies.",
