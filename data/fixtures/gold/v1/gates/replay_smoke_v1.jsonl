The Borrower shall\ngive the Agent at least five Business Days (or such shorter period of time as the Agent may agree in its sole discretion) prior written\nnotice requesting the incurrence of any Letter of Credit Obligation. The notice shall be accompanied by a completed Letter of Credit\napplication. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Letter of Credit applications by the Borrower and communications\nby the Agent and the L/C Issuer may be made and transmitted pursuant to electronic codes and security measures mutually agreed upon and\nestablished by and between the Borrower and the L/C Issuer. The Borrower hereby authorizes the L/C Issuer and the Agent to accept, act\nupon, and treat as genuine and original (but without any obligation of the L/C Issuer or the Agent to do any of the foregoing) applications,\nauthorizations, and other requests regardless of the manner communicated, including those sent or communicated via overnight courier,\ncertified or non-certified mail, fax, email, electronic code, or phone, so long as the L/C Issuer does not have actual knowledge that\na particular application, authorization, or other request is not authorized by the Borrower. \n \n \n \n (ii)\nLetters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Revolving Loan Commitments. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,\nextended, reinstated, or otherwise amended only if (and, upon issuance, extension, reinstatement or other amendment of each Letter of\nCredit, the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that) after giving effect to such issuance, extension, reinstatement or\nother amendment (i) the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Obligations shall not at any time exceed $4,000,000 (the \u201c L/C Sublimit \u201d);\n(ii) no Lender will exceed its individual Revolving Loan Commitment; (iii) the aggregate amount of all borrowings and Letter of Credit\nObligations incurred under this Agreement shall not exceed the total Revolving Loan Commitments; and (iv) the aggregate amount of all\nborrowings and Letter of Credit Obligations incurred under this Agreement shall not exceed the Borrowing Base. \n \n \n \n (iii)\nThe Borrower is responsible for preparing or approving the text of each Letter of Credit as submitted to and as issued by the L/C Issuer\nand as received by the beneficiary, notwithstanding any drafting recommendations or forms provided by the L/C Issuer. the L/C Issuer\u2019s\nrecommendation or drafting of text or the L/C Issuer\u2019s use or non-use or refusal to use text submitted by the Borrower shall not\naffect the Borrower\u2019s ultimate responsibility. The Borrower is responsible for the L/C Issuer\u2019s failure to apply, or to observe\nstandard practice as applied to, Letter of Credit terms or conditions, and for terms or conditions that (A) are erroneous, ambiguous,\ninconsistent, insufficient, ineffective, or illegal, (B) require the L/C Issuer to respond to a demand in fewer than three Business Days,\nor (C) require or allow the Borrower to sign, issue, or present a document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,\nthe L/C Issuer\u2019s obligation to issue, amend, or extend the expiration date of a Letter of Credit is subject to its review and approval\nof the proposed terms of the Letter of Credit (and any amendment thereof) in its sole discretion. The Borrower represents and warrants\nto the L/C Issuer that the Borrower is familiar with, and understands, applicable Law and letter of credit practice. If requested by\nthe L/C Issuer, the Borrower will execute, deliver, and submit a letter of credit application and reimbursement agreement on the L/C\nIssuer\u2019s standard forms in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms\nand conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any such letter of credit application or reimbursement agreement, the\nterms and conditions of this Agreement will control, for so long as the Borrower and the L/C Issuer are subject thereto. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to the Borrower\u2019s ultimate responsibility as set forth above in this paragraph\n(a) , the L/C Issuer\u2019s obligation to issue, amend, or extend the expiration date of a Letter of Credit is subject to its review\nand approval of the proposed terms of the Letter of Credit (and any amendment thereof) in its sole discretion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A- 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (iv)\nThe Borrower will notify the L/C Issuer in writing no later than three Business Days (or such longer period of time as the L/C Issuer\nmay agree in its sole discretion) after the Borrower first becomes aware of any objection the Borrower may have to the L/C Issuer\u2019s\nissuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer\u2019s acceptance or rejection of a presentation under any Letter of Credit,\nor any other action or inaction taken or proposed to be taken by the L/C Issuer under or in connection with this Agreement or any other\nagreement, document, or instrument relating hereto; provided that if the L/C Issuer reasonably believes that it is obligated to\ntake any action, including, but not limited to, the payment on a Letter of Credit in a period of time less than three Business Days,\nthe L/C Issuer is allowed to take such action without liability to the Borrower. The Borrower\u2019s failure to give timely and specific\nnotice of objection shall automatically waive the Borrower\u2019s objection, authorize or ratify the L/C Issuer\u2019s action or inaction,\nand absolutely preclude the Borrower from raising the objection as a defense or claim against the L/C Issuer (or any Indemnitee). If\nthe L/C Issuer approaches the Borrower for a waiver of discrepancies in a presentation, then the Borrower must respond within three Business\nDays (or such longer period of time as the L/C Issuer may agree in its sole discretion). The L/C Issuer may treat the Borrower\u2019s\nfailure to respond as a waiver of the indicated discrepancies, but need not itself accept the Borrower\u2019s implied or express waiver\nof discrepancies as binding on the L/C Issuer. The Borrower\u2019s acceptance or retention of any documents presented under or in connection\nwith a Letter of Credit (including, but not limited to, originals or copies of documents sent directly to the Borrower) or of any property\nfor which payment is supported by any Letter of Credit shall ratify the L/C Issuer\u2019s honor of the relevant presentation and absolutely\npreclude the Borrower from raising a defense or claim against the L/C Issuer (or any Indemnitee) with respect to such honor. \n \n \n \n (b)\n Expiration Date . Except for Evergreen Letters of Credit that are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this paragraph,\nno Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date that is later than the earlier of (i) one year following the date of issuance thereof\n(or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, whether automatic or by amendment, one year after then-current expiration\ndate of such Letter of Credit) unless otherwise permitted by the L/C Issuer (subject to the other provisions of this Agreement) and (ii)\nthe date that is five Business Days before the Commitment Termination Date, and neither the Agent nor Lenders shall be under any obligation\nto incur Letter of Credit Obligations in respect of, or purchase or acquire participations in, any Letter of Credit having an expiration\ndate that is later than the Commitment Termination Date. If the Borrower so requests in any notice requesting the issuance of a Letter\nof Credit (or the amendment of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter\nof Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an \u201c Evergreen Letter of Credit \u201d); provided that any\nsuch Evergreen Letter of Credit shall permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each one-year period (commencing\nwith the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the \u201c Non-Extension\nNotice Date \u201d) in each such one-year period to be agreed upon by the Borrower and the L/C Issuer at the time such Letter of\nCredit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C\nIssuer for any such extension. Once an Evergreen Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but\nmay not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiration date not later than the\nexpiration date permitted under this paragraph. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A- 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (c)\n Participations . \n \n \n \n (i)\nBy the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the expiration date thereof),\nand without any further action on the part of the L/C Issuer or the Lenders, the L/C Issuer hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender\nhereby acquires from the L/C Issuer, a participation in such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Obligations equal to such\nLender\u2019s Pro Rata Share. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph\nis absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any extension, reinstatement\nor other amendment of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving\nLoan Commitments. \n \n \n \n (ii)\nIn consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely, unconditionally, and irrevocably agrees to pay to\nthe Agent, for account of the L/C Issuer, such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of each payment made by the L/C Issuer promptly upon the\nrequest of the L/C Issuer at any time from the time of such payment until such payment is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after\nany reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, including after the Commitment Termination Date.\nSuch payment by each Lender shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding, or reduction whatsoever (including any offset,\nabatement, withholding or reduction relating to or arising out of those matters set forth in paragraph (h) below), and shall be\nmade in the same manner as provided in this Agreement with respect to Revolving Credit Advances (and such provisions shall apply, mutatis\nmutandis , to the payment obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph). The Agent shall promptly pay to the L/C Issuer the amounts\nso received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to paragraph\n(d) below, the Agent shall distribute such payment to the L/C Issuer or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant\nto this paragraph to reimburse the L/C Issuer, to such Lenders and the L/C Issuer as their interests may appear. Any payment made by\na Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any payment under a Letter of Credit shall not constitute an Advance\nand shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Letter of Credit payment, unless the Borrower has financed such\npayment with a Base Rate Loan or Swing Line Advance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. \n \n \n \n (iii)\nEach Lender acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Obligations will\nbe automatically adjusted to reflect adjustments in such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share from time to time. \n \n \n \n (iv)\nThe obligations of Lenders under the paragraphs above shall be for the benefit of the Agent and the L/C Issuer and may be enforced by\nthe L/C Issuer. \n \n \n \n (d)\n Reimbursement and Interim Interest . \n \n \n \n (i)\nIf the L/C Issuer shall make any disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer by paying\nto the Agent an amount equal to such disbursement in immediately available U.S. dollars, without withholding, deduction, or setoff, not\nlater than 1:00 p.m. prevailing local time in New York, NY on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of the L/C Issuer\u2019s\ndisbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m. prevailing local time in new York, NY; or (ii) the Business Day immediately\nfollowing the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, with interest at the rate\napplicable to Base Rate Loans for the additional calendar day(s) elapsed; provided that, if such disbursement by the L/C Issuer\nis not less than $2,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth in this Agreement, request in accordance\nwith Section 2.1 or 2.3 that such payment be financed with a Base Rate Loan or Swing Line Advance in an equivalent amount,\nand to the extent so financed, the Borrower\u2019s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting\nBase Rate Loan or Swing Line Advance. The L/C Issuer\u2019s records showing the dates and amounts of payments due and disbursements\nmade shall be presumed correct and complete and, if the Borrower does not object within five Business Days after receiving the information,\nshall be final. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable payment under\nthe Letter of Credit, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof, and such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share thereof. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A- 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (ii)\nIf the Borrower fails to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount disbursed when due pursuant to paragraph (d)(i) above, then the\nunpaid amount shall bear interest, for each day from the date such disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses\nthe L/C Issuer for such disbursement, at the Default Rate. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the L/C\nIssuer, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) above to reimburse\nthe L/C Issuer shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. \n \n \n \n (e)\n Limitations . The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: \n \n \n \n (i)\nany order, judgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall enjoin or restrain, or purport to enjoin or restrain,\nthe L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or request that such the L/C Issuer refrain from, or, if in the sole discretion of\nthe L/C Issuer, any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer shall prohibit the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit\nin particular, or any such order, judgment or decree, or Law shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any\nrestriction, reserve, capital or liquidity requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect\non the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost, or expense that was not applicable on the Closing\nDate and that the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it; \n \n \n \n (ii)\nthe issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer; \n \n \n \n (iii)\nexcept as otherwise agreed by the Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial amount less than $50,000, in the case\nof a commercial Letter of Credit, or $50,000, in the case of a standby Letter of Credit; or \n \n \n \n (iv)\nany Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral,\nsatisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer\u2019s actual or\npotential fronting exposure (after giving effect to any reallocation under Section 2.12 ) with respect to the Defaulting Lender\narising from either such Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or such Letter of Credit and all other Letter of Credit Obligations\nas to which the L/C Issuer has actual or potential fronting exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. \n \n \n \n The\nL/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to\nissue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept\nthe proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. \n \n \n \n (f)\n Cash Collateral . \n \n \n \n (i)\nIf the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral for any Letter of Credit Obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including Section\n9.2 , prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower will pay to the Agent for the ratable benefit of itself and Lenders cash\nor Cash Equivalents acceptable to the Agent (\u201c Cash Collateral \u201d) in an amount equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit\nObligations. Such Cash Collateral shall be held by the Agent and pledged to, and subject to the control of, the Agent, for the benefit\nof the Agent, Lenders, and the L/C Issuer. The Borrower hereby pledges and grants to the Agent, on behalf of itself and Lenders, a security\ninterest in all such Cash Collateral and all proceeds thereof, as security for the payment of all amounts due in respect of the Letter\nof Credit Obligations and other Obligations, whether or not then due. This Agreement, including this paragraph (f)(i) , shall constitute\na security agreement under applicable Law. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A- 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (ii)\nIf any Letter of Credit Obligations, whether or not then due and payable, shall for any reason be outstanding on the Commitment Termination\nDate, the Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral within two Business Days (or such longer period of time as the Agent may agree in its\nsole discretion) therefor in the manner described, and subject to the terms and conditions as set forth, above. \n \n \n \n (iii)\nFrom time to time after funds are deposited as Cash Collateral by the Borrower, whether before or after the Commitment Termination Date,\nthe Agent may apply such funds then held by it to the payment of any amounts, and in such order as the Agent may elect, as shall be or\nshall become due and payable by the Borrower to the Agent and Lenders with respect to such Letter of Credit Obligations of the Borrower\nand, upon the satisfaction in full of all Letter of Credit Obligations of the Borrower, to any other Obligations then due and payable. \n \n \n \n (iv)\nNeither the Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the Cash Collateral,\nexcept that upon the termination of all Letter of Credit Obligations (which requires the return of all original Letters of Credit) and\nthe payment of all amounts payable by the Borrower to the Agent and Lenders in respect thereof, any remaining Cash Collateral shall be\napplied to other Obligations then due and owing and upon payment in full of such Obligations any remaining amount shall be paid to the\nBorrower or as otherwise required by Law. Interest earned, if any, on Cash Collateral shall be held as additional collateral. \n \n \n \n (g)\n Fees and Expenses . In addition to the Letter of Credit Fees payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(iii) , the Borrower shall\npay to the L/C Issuer, on demand, such Letter of Credit Fees as are set forth from time to time in the L/C Issuer\u2019s Fee schedule\nfor letters of credit. The Borrower acknowledges that the L/C Issuer may modify such Fee schedule at any time and will communicate such\nnew Fee schedule information to the Borrower as required in the notice provision hereunder. Such new Fees will be effective 30 days after\nsuch notice and shall apply as of such date to all existing and future Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer. In the event of any\ninconsistency between the Fees set forth in this Agreement and the Fees set forth in such Fee schedule, the Fees set forth in this Agreement\nwill control. \n \n \n \n (h)\n Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer, the Agent, and Lenders for payments made with\nrespect to any Letter of Credit Obligation shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable, and not subject to abatement, reduction,\nwithholding, deduction, deferment, interruption, recoupment, or other right (whether legal, equitable, or otherwise) for any reason whatsoever,\nwithout necessity of presentment, demand, protest, or other formalities, and the obligations of each Lender to make payments to the Agent\nwith respect to Letters of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable.

\n \n \n \n (v)\nthe fact that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; \n \n \n \n (vi)\nany bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, or similar proceeding discharging or otherwise affecting the Borrower or any\nof its Affiliates; \n \n \n \n (vii)\nthe Agent\u2019s, the L/C Issuer\u2019s, or any other Lender\u2019s rights and remedies with respect to any collateral; \n \n \n \n (viii)\nthe Borrower\u2019s claims, rights, or remedies against any of its Affiliates;

\n \n \n \n (xi)\nany loss or damage to any collateral; \n \n \n \n (xii)\nthe failure of any lien or security interest in favor of the Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders) to attach, be perfected or recorded,\nor remain perfected or recorded; \n \n \n \n (xiii)\nthe Agent\u2019s release of any collateral, or taking of additional collateral, and the Borrower waives any and all rights with respect\nto all of the foregoing; or \n \n \n \n (xiv)\nany other circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this\n Annex A , constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower\u2019s obligations\nhereunder, and the Borrower waives any and all rights with respect to all of the foregoing. \n \n \n \n (i)\n L/C Issuer Discretion . \n \n \n \n (i)\nFor the Borrower\u2019s account, the L/C Issuer may at any time provide in a Letter of Credit or otherwise agree to do or do the following: \n \n \n \n (A)\nsend the Letter of Credit via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (\u201c SWIFT \u201d) network and\nbind the Borrower directly and as an indemnifier to the rules applicable to SWIFT messages (including, but not limited to, rules obligating\nthe Borrower or the L/C Issuer to pay bank charges);

In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent\nand the Lenders; and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without\nconsent from the Lenders). \n (b) Any such request shall be\nmade to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Credit Extension (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such\nrequest pertaining to Letters of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer, in its or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof; and in\nthe case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable L/C Issuer thereof. Each Lender (in the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Loans) or the applicable L/C\nIssuer (in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making\nof Eurocurrency Rate Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such requested currency. \n \n (c) Any failure by a Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, as\nthe case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or such L/C issuer, as the case may be, to permit Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made or Letters of\nCredit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Lenders consent to making Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall\nthereupon be deemed for all purposes to be a Foreign Currency hereunder for purposes of any Borrowings of Eurocurrency Rate Loans; and if the Administrative and the applicable L/C Issuer consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested\ncurrency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be a Foreign Currency hereunder for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances by such L/C Issuer. If the Administrative\nAgent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an \n \n \n 32 \n \n \n \n \n \nadditional currency under this Section 1.08 , the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Borrower. \n \n 1.09 Change of Currency . Each obligation of the Borrower to make a\npayment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption. If, in relation to the\ncurrency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in\nrespect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any Borrowing in the currency of such\nmember state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

Any such Collateral Servicing Fee, once waived, shall not thereafter become due and payable and any claim of the Collateral Servicer therein shall be extinguished. \n \n (e) At any time during or after the Reinvestment Period, any Holder of Subordinated Notes may (i) make a Contribution of\nCash, Eligible Investments or Collateral Obligations or (ii) solely in the case of the Certificated Subordinated Notes, in accordance with Section 8.3(h) , designate any portion of Interest Proceeds or Principal\nProceeds that would otherwise be distributed on a Payment Date to such Holder of Subordinated Notes to be instead deposited in the Supplemental Reserve Account as a contribution to the Issuer (a \u201c Contribution \u201d and each such\nPerson, a \u201c Contributor \u201d); provided that (x) each Contribution must be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $500,000 and (y) a Notice of Contribution in the form of Exhibit E (solely for Contributions of\nCash or Eligible Investments) is provided. The Collateral Servicer, on behalf of the Issuer, may accept or reject any Contribution in its sole discretion and shall notify the Collateral Trustee and the Collateral Administrator of any such\nacceptance. Each accepted Contribution of Cash or Eligible Investments shall be deposited into the Supplemental Reserve Account and may be withdrawn at the written direction of the Collateral Servicer. Contributions of Cash or Eligible Investments\nmay only be used for a Permitted Use or Permitted Uses as directed by the applicable Contributor at the time such Contribution is made, so long as the Collateral Servicer consents to such Permitted Use(s) (or, if no direction is given by the\nContributor, at the Collateral Servicer\u2019s reasonable discretion). No Contribution of Cash or Eligible Investments or portion thereof will be returned to any applicable holder of Subordinated Notes at any time. From time to time, the Initial\nSubordinated Noteholder may make Contributions or transfers of Cash, Eligible Investments or Collateral Obligations, or any combination thereof, either directly or through one or more intermediate related entities or Affiliates, to the Issuer. For\nadministrative convenience any Contributions or transfers of Cash, Eligible Investments or Collateral Obligations made through one or more intermediate related entities or Affiliates of the Initial Subordinated Noteholder may instead be made\ndirectly into the Issuer, and by \n \n \n -209- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbypassing such intermediate related entity or Affiliate. The value received by the Issuer in Cash, Eligible Investments and/or in the form of Collateral Obligations will not be affected by the\nelimination of such intermediate steps. In the case of any such payment made to the Issuer in the form of a combination of Cash and Collateral Obligations, the Cash portion of such payment shall be an amount equal to the total payment required to be\nmade to the Issuer reduced by an amount equal to the fair market value as determined by the Collateral Servicer as of the date of contribution of the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments contributed in a Contribution or transferred to the\nIssuer in respect of such payment. \n (f) Notwithstanding the Priority of Payments, the Issuer may make Permitted RIC\nDistributions to the Holders of the Subordinated Notes subject to the conditions for such distributions set forth in the definition of \u201cPermitted RIC Distributions.\u201d ", "char_start":
