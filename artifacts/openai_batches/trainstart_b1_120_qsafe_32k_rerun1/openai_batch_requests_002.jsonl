Output valid JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).\n\nDecision policy:\n1. `accepted`:\n   - Deterministic structure is clear and defensible.\n   - Inline-only enumerations that are NOT structural should result in `gold_nodes: []` when appropriate.\n2. `review`:\n   - Two plausible structural interpretations remain after full-context reading.\n3. `abstain`:\n   - Source integrity is compromised (for example TOC/index blocks, signature pages, cross-section spillover, truncation, repeated stitched sections, or heavy OCR/layout corruption).\n   - Use abstain rather than forcing uncertain structure.\n\nStructural labeling rules:\n1. Do NOT treat cross-references as structural nodes (for example `Section 10.1(a)`).\n2. Do NOT treat inline list markers inside a single running sentence as structural nodes unless they clearly open independent clause blocks.\n3. For each structural node included:\n   - `span_start` and `span_end` must be exact 0-indexed offsets into the provided raw text.\n   - `span_end` is exclusive.\n4. If no reliable structural nodes exist, return `gold_nodes: []`.\n\nReasoning and metadata rules:\n1. `reason_codes` must be 1-3 concise machine-readable strings.\n2. `adjudication.rationale` must be specific to this row (not a template sentence).\n3. Set:\n   - `adjudication.human_verified` = false\n   - `adjudication.ambiguity_class` = `none|A1|A2|A3` as appropriate\n   - `adjudication.adjudicator_id` = `openai-batch-adjudicator-v1`\n   - `adjudication.adjudicated_at` = `2026-02-28T00:00:00Z`\n\nQuality bar:\n1. Never hallucinate section content or clause nodes not present in raw text.\n2. If integrity is doubtful, abstain with explicit contamination rationale.\n3. Prefer precision over recall for structural nodes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task_type\": \"gold_fixture_adjudication\", \"queue_item_id\": \"P1-ADJUDICATION-TRAINSTART-0120\", \"fixture_context\": {\"fixture_id\": \"GFV1C-XREF_VS_STRUCTURAL-0183\", \"category\": \"xref_vs_structural\", \"source\": {\"doc_id\": \"02b17b4cdedc0a81\", \"section_number\": \"2.06\", \"snapshot_id\": \"ray_v2_corpus_build_20260227T041350Z_4e318cf8\"}, \"split\": \"train\", \"seed_gold_decision\": \"abstain\", \"seed_reason_codes\": [\"ABS_XREF_STRUCTURAL_CONFLICT\"]}, \"seed_parser_summary\": {\"node_count\": 32, \"structural_count\": 17, \"xref_count\": 5, \"duplicate_id_count\": 9}, \"raw_text_char_len\": 9113, \"raw_text\": \"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Section 2.06 Interest on Loans. \\n (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(d) , the Loans comprising each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, including each Swingline Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time. \\n (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(d) , the Loans comprising each Borrowing of Term SOFR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time. \\n (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(d) , the Loans comprising each Borrowing of Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternative Currency Term Rate for such Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin; it being understood that no Loans will bear interest at the Term CORRA Rate at any time prior to the Canadian Activation Date. \\n (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section 11.01 or Section 11.05 , (x) overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) for Base Rate Loans and associated interest, 2.00% per annum in excess of the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus the Base Rate, (ii) for Term SOFR Rate Loans and associated interest, 2.00% per annum in excess of the Applicable Margin for Term SOFR Rate Loans plus the Term SOFR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing and (iii) for Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans and associated interest, 2.00% per annum in excess of the Applicable Margin for Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans plus the Alternative Currency Term Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing and (y) overdue Fees shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2.00% per annum in excess of the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus the Base Rate, each as in effect from time to time, in each case with such interest to be payable on demand. \\n (e) For purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever any interest or fee under this Agreement is calculated using a rate based on a year of 360 or 365 days or any other period of time that is less than a calendar year, the rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (x) the applicable rate based on the number of days in the calendar year, (y) multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for which such interest is payable (or compounded) ends, and (z) divided by 360, 365 or such other period of time that is less than the calendar year, as the case may be, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this Agreement, and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated in this Agreement are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.
