For each structural node included:\n   - `span_start` and `span_end` must be exact 0-indexed offsets into the provided raw text.\n   - `span_end` is exclusive.\n4. If no reliable structural nodes exist, return `gold_nodes: []`.\n\nReasoning and metadata rules:\n1. `reason_codes` must be 1-3 concise machine-readable strings.\n2. `adjudication.rationale` must be specific to this row (not a template sentence).\n3.

Produce the highest-fidelity structural labels possible from the provided raw section text.\n2. Prefer safe abstention over confident error when section integrity is compromised.\n\nHard requirements:\n1. Read the full provided `raw_text` and use only that evidence.\n2. Preserve these fields exactly from input context unless impossible:\n   - `fixture_id`\n   - `category`\n   - `source.doc_id`\n   - `source.section_number`\n   - `source.snapshot_id`\n   - `split`\n3. Set `text.raw_text` to an empty string `\"\"` in your output for compact storage.\n4. Set `text.char_start` to `0`.\n5. Set `text.char_end` to the provided `raw_text_char_len`.\n6. Output valid JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).\n\nDecision policy:\n1. `accepted`:\n   - Deterministic structure is clear and defensible.\n   - Inline-only enumerations that are NOT structural should result in `gold_nodes: []` when appropriate.\n2. `review`:\n   - Two plausible structural interpretations remain after full-context reading.\n3. `abstain`:\n   - Source integrity is compromised (for example TOC/index blocks, signature pages, cross-section spillover, truncation, repeated stitched sections, or heavy OCR/layout corruption).\n   - Use abstain rather than forcing uncertain structure.\n\nStructural labeling rules:\n1. Do NOT treat cross-references as structural nodes (for example `Section 10.1(a)`).\n2. Do NOT treat inline list markers inside a single running sentence as structural nodes unless they clearly open independent clause blocks.\n3. For each structural node included:\n   - `span_start` and `span_end` must be exact 0-indexed offsets into the provided raw text.\n   - `span_end` is exclusive.\n4. If no reliable structural nodes exist, return `gold_nodes: []`.\n\nReasoning and metadata rules:\n1. `reason_codes` must be 1-3 concise machine-readable strings.\n2. `adjudication.rationale` must be specific to this row (not a template sentence).\n3. Set:\n   - `adjudication.human_verified` = false\n   - `adjudication.ambiguity_class` = `none|A1|A2|A3` as appropriate\n   - `adjudication.adjudicator_id` = `openai-batch-adjudicator-v1`\n   - `adjudication.adjudicated_at` = `2026-02-28T00:00:00Z`\n\nQuality bar:\n1. Never hallucinate section content or clause nodes not present in raw text.\n2. If integrity is doubtful, abstain with explicit contamination rationale.\n3.
