Subject to clause\\n(d)(iii) of this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the limitations and requirements of those Sections and Section 2.19) to the same extent\\nas if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 9.04.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each party hereto shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such\\nparticipation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Without limitation of the requirements of Section 9.04(d), no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register\\nto any person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant\\u2019s interest in any Commitments, Loans or other Loan Obligations under any Loan Document), except to the extent that such disclosure is\\nnecessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other Loan Obligation is in registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes or is otherwise required by applicable law.

Pursuant to any such assignment, all Loans and Commitments to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated among the Lenders under such Facility in the same manner as would be required\\nif such Loans were being optionally prepaid or such Commitments were being optionally reduced or terminated by the Borrower), accompanied by payment of any accrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.05(b). By\\nreceiving such purchase price, the Lenders under such Facility shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or Commitments under such Facility pursuant to the terms of the form of Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit\\nA , and accordingly no other action by such Lenders shall be required in connection therewith. The provisions of this clause (h) are intended to facilitate the maintenance of the perfection and priority of existing security interests in the\\nCollateral during any such replacement. \\n \\n \\n 157 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Table of Contents \\n \\n (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c)\\n(which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (i) or (j) of this Section 9.04), any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower, may purchase by way of assignment and become an Assignee with respect to Term Loans at\\nany time and from time to time from Lenders in accordance with Section 9.04(b) hereof (each, a \\u201c Permitted Loan Purchase \\u201d); provided , that, in respect of any Permitted Loan Purchase, (A) no Permitted Loan Purchase\\nshall be made from the proceeds of any extensions of credit under the Revolving Facility, (B) upon consummation of any such Permitted Loan Purchase, the Loans purchased pursuant thereto shall be deemed to be automatically and immediately\\ncancelled and extinguished in accordance with Section 9.04(j), (C) in connection with any such Permitted Loan Purchase, any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower and such Lender that is the Assignor shall execute and\\ndeliver to the Administrative Agent a Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance (and for the avoidance of doubt, (x) shall make the representations and warranties set forth in the Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance and\\n(y) shall not be required to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) and shall otherwise comply with the conditions to Assignments under this Section 9.04 and (D) no Default or Event\\nof Default would exist immediately after giving effect on a Pro Forma Basis to such Permitted Loan Purchase. \\n (j) Each Permitted Loan\\nPurchase shall, for purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be an automatic and immediate cancellation and extinguishment of such Term Loans and the Borrower shall, upon consummation of any Permitted Loan Purchase, notify the Administrative Agent\\nthat the Register be updated to record such event as if it were a prepayment of such Loans. \\n (k) In connection with any assignment of\\nrights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the\\nAdministrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with\\nthe consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to\\n(x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Swingline Lender or any other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and\\nfund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Facility Percentage; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any\\nassignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting\\nLender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. \"}"}]}}

In case of the pendency of any Insolvency Proceeding relative to\\nBorrower or any other Credit Party, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of the Loans shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have\\nmade any demand on Borrower or another Credit Party) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: \\n \\n (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, and all other\\nliabilities that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders and Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and\\nadvances of Lenders and Administrative Agent and their respective agents and attorneys and all other amounts due Lenders and Administrative Agent under this Agreement) allowed in such judicial proceedings; and \\n \\n (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; \\n \\n \\n 134 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar\\nofficial in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to Lenders, to pay to\\nAdministrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Administrative Agent and its agents and attorneys, and any other amounts due Administrative Agent hereunder. \\n \\n Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any\\nLender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, affecting the liabilities or to authorize Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. \\n \\n 13.12 Return of Payments . If Administrative Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a\\nrelated payment has been or will be received by Administrative Agent from Borrower and such related payment is not received by Administrative Agent, then Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand\\nwithout set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, together with interest accruing on a daily basis at the Federal Funds Rate. If Administrative Agent determines at any time that any amount received by\\nAdministrative Agent under this Agreement must be returned to Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document,\\nAdministrative Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition, each Lender shall repay to Administrative Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Administrative Agent has distributed to such Lender,\\ntogether with interest at such rate, if any, as Administrative Agent is required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. \\n \\n 13.13 Inspection Deliveries . In the event Administrative Agent exercises its right to conduct an inspection of each Credit Party\\u2019s\\nproperties, assets and/or facilities pursuant to Section 5.7 , Administrative Agent agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver (at the sole cost and expense of Borrower) copies of any and all written\\ndocumentation or written information received by Administrative Agent in connection with such inspection to each Lender; provided , however , that failure of Administrative Agent to so deliver any of the foregoing for any reason shall\\nnot impose any liability on Administrative Agent whatsoever. \"}"}]}}

For each structural node included:\n   - `span_start` and `span_end` must be exact 0-indexed offsets into the provided raw text.\n   - `span_end` is exclusive.\n4. If no reliable structural nodes exist, return `gold_nodes: []`.\n\nReasoning and metadata rules:\n1. `reason_codes` must be 1-3 concise machine-readable strings.\n2. `adjudication.rationale` must be specific to this row (not a template sentence).\n3.

Produce the highest-fidelity structural labels possible from the provided raw section text.\n2. Prefer safe abstention over confident error when section integrity is compromised.\n\nHard requirements:\n1. Read the full provided `raw_text` and use only that evidence.\n2. Preserve these fields exactly from input context unless impossible:\n   - `fixture_id`\n   - `category`\n   - `source.doc_id`\n   - `source.section_number`\n   - `source.snapshot_id`\n   - `split`\n3. Set `text.raw_text` to an empty string `\"\"` in your output for compact storage.\n4. Set `text.char_start` to `0`.\n5. Set `text.char_end` to the provided `raw_text_char_len`.\n6. Output valid JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).\n\nDecision policy:\n1. `accepted`:\n   - Deterministic structure is clear and defensible.\n   - Inline-only enumerations that are NOT structural should result in `gold_nodes: []` when appropriate.\n2. `review`:\n   - Two plausible structural interpretations remain after full-context reading.\n3. `abstain`:\n   - Source integrity is compromised (for example TOC/index blocks, signature pages, cross-section spillover, truncation, repeated stitched sections, or heavy OCR/layout corruption).\n   - Use abstain rather than forcing uncertain structure.\n\nStructural labeling rules:\n1. Do NOT treat cross-references as structural nodes (for example `Section 10.1(a)`).\n2. Do NOT treat inline list markers inside a single running sentence as structural nodes unless they clearly open independent clause blocks.\n3. For each structural node included:\n   - `span_start` and `span_end` must be exact 0-indexed offsets into the provided raw text.\n   - `span_end` is exclusive.\n4. If no reliable structural nodes exist, return `gold_nodes: []`.\n\nReasoning and metadata rules:\n1. `reason_codes` must be 1-3 concise machine-readable strings.\n2. `adjudication.rationale` must be specific to this row (not a template sentence).\n3. Set:\n   - `adjudication.human_verified` = false\n   - `adjudication.ambiguity_class` = `none|A1|A2|A3` as appropriate\n   - `adjudication.adjudicator_id` = `openai-batch-adjudicator-v1`\n   - `adjudication.adjudicated_at` = `2026-02-28T00:00:00Z`\n\nQuality bar:\n1.
