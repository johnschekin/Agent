{"row_id":"P0-ADJUDICATION-0030","witness":"Section 1.01 Defined Terms appears as a full glossary from ABR/Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement through Wholly-Owned Subsidiary and Write-Down and Conversion Powers.","hypothesis_A":"Keep as review because the proper structural unit is each defined term entry, not one section-wide clause tree.","hypothesis_B":"Accept by deriving a global hierarchy from glossary text and internal references.","why_A_survives":"Per-term units are explicit and stable; section-wide structural inference across definitions is ambiguous and low-signal for clause parsing.","why_B_survives":"Hypothesis B fails because forced global topology would generate synthetic parent-child labels and degrade training quality.","final_decision":"review","confidence":"high","quarantined_from_training":true,"full_section_reviewed":true,"section_text_sha256":"77f48744e415f7d009a1f294280461c07c21ea05ae40a420f176ac8f05e32f39"}
