# Key Credit Terms — Risk Taxonomy

## Category 1: Covenant Protection

1. (a) No financial covenants for RCFs or TLAs[^1] or (b) breach of financial  covenants only applies as a condition to Borrowing and will not result in an Event of Default (i.e., breaching the financial covenant results only in a drawstop of any unfunded committed amount).
2. Equity Cure Issues:  (a) Equity cure provision does not require injection of new equity (cash/assets) into the restricted group after the closing date to cure a financial covenant default; [^2] (b) Equity cure documented as subordinated shareholder debt or third-party subordinated holdco debt.
  - If clause (b) exists, note if (x) there is any parameters listed for such debt such as “payment subordinated terms (including as to maturity, limitations on repayments and prepayments and limitations on enforcement actions) and/or if there is language indicating such debt is subject to Agent’s satisfaction; (y) the subordinated debt is limited by any other covenants.
3. RCF springer covenant threshold issues:  Threshold for revolver draw that acts as springing trigger to test compliance with the financial covenant (a) exceeds 40% of total RCF size and/or (b) is based on a fixed size and is does not reduce proportionally as RCF reduces and/or (c) is calculated net of cash on balance sheet (i.e., cash on balance sheet is permitted to be deducted from drawn RC amount to calculate springing trigger) and/or (d) excludes revolver drawings used to fund capex investments and/or (e) permits the borrower to repay the RCF below the threshold level after the end of the testing period to avoid testing the financial covenant and cure a default under the financial covenant.
For ABL  Credit Facilities: (a) if springer to test financial covenants is below 10% Availability threshold and/or greater than 50% dilution is allowed in the Availability calculation based on Suppressed Availability or unrestricted cash/cash equivalents; and/or (b) longer than 5 business days consecutive below Availability threshold is required to spring.
4. Deemed cure of breach of financial covenant through the delivery of updated financial reports (and compliance certificates) showing compliance with the financial covenant at any point in time after the end of a testing period based on management accounts and calculations made by the borrower.
5. Debt incurred under fixed baskets (such as freebie, non-guarantor debt basket, general debt basket, or acquisition debt basket) excluded or allowed to be excluded from calculating compliance with financial covenant.
6. (a) Revenue “addbacks” to EBITDA, including in respect of (i) adjustments for loss of revenues such as COVID/pandemic-related revenue adjustments or (ii) revenue synergies including in connection with new contracts; (b) new contracts as revenue synergies: flag whether new contracts are an addback.[^3]
7. Uncapped addbacks to EBITDA for cost savings, run rate, synergies, etc., including adjustments under Regulation S-X given recent expansion of its scope.[^4]
8. Consolidated Net Income and/or EBITDA adjustments for cash dividends to loan parties from unrestricted subsidiaries not limited to dividends resulting from earned income.[^5]

## Category 2: Ability to increase leverage/debt

1. (a) Note if Consolidated Total Debt or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio are not a true total debt calculation and exclude certain types of debt such as second lien debt, revolving credit facility debt, working capital debt, subordinated debt, senior unsecured notes, etc.;
(b) identify baskets (and their respective sizes) that may be stacked, or may be reclassified to allow the incurrence of additional pari or structurally senior debt.  Items to raise as factors that are used in basket calculations are suggested below but please include other baskets or factors as appropriate:
  - Opening first lien leverage multiple / 1L incurrence ratio basket
  - Pari passu capacity includes each of the following, which may be stacked:
  - Structurally senior capacity includes each of the following, which may be stacked:
  - Identify amount of Investment baskets that can be reclassified/reallocated to pari passu debt
  - Identify Restricted Payment amount that can be reclassified/reallocated to pari passu debt
  - Grandfathered contribution debt capacity
2. For purposes of incurring post-closing Delayed Draw Term Loans (“DDTL”), once a DDTL commitment or DDTL is tested via a ratio debt incurrence test (either at time of incurrence of the DDTL commitment or at time of drawdown of the DDTL), then such incurrence test (and all ratio debt incurrence tests going forward) should account for all DDTL commitments or DDTLs, as applicable, at all times going forward so long as such DDTL commitment or DDTL is in existence.[^6]
3. Permit uncapped issuance of preferred stock at a non-guarantor restricted subsidiary that would be structurally senior to lenders or excluded from debt incurrence or covenant calculations.
4. High water marking – usually included in the interpretative provisions of credit agreements dealing with baskets testing/adjustments/calculations; it works to increase grower baskets (i.e., those tied typically to percentage of EBITDA and vary as the size of EBITDA changes during the life of the credit agreement) such that grower baskets are deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower component (typically, EBITDA) reached from time to time and such grower basket is not subsequently reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component that may result from asset sales, underperformance or otherwise.[^7]
  - For instance, if the freebie basket, also known as the “free and clear basket” is the higher of $X million and 100% of EBITDA, the size of the freebie basket is permanently reset to the highest adjusted EBITDA reported even if EBITDA decreases afterwards.

## Category 3: Dilution of Lender Rights

1. Please refer to Appendix I.
2. “Statute of Limitations” of 2 years that either (i) is not tied solely to the delivery of a notice of default or (ii) has no carve-out for failure to provide notice of default despite the Borrower or Responsible Officer of Borrower having knowledge of the default in question.
3. Inclusion of “Net Short” Lender (“NSL”) disenfranchisement provisions that could impact Lenders’ (i) voting rights, and/or (ii) ability to transfer the loan to NSL, including treating NSL as defaulting lenders, (unless such NSLs fall within the scope of standard defaulting lender and/or sanctioned lender provisions), without customary carve-outs for (x) Regulated Banks and Revolving Lenders and the affiliates of Regulated Banks and Revolving Lenders and (y) market making activities.[^8]
4. LENDER1, in its capacity as a lender, is prohibited from entering into a total return swap, total rate of return swap, credit default swap or other derivative instrument with any counterparty that is a Disqualified Institution (whether or not obligations under the facility are reference obligations).
5. Changes to Sacred Rights permitted without an all lender or “affected lender” vote.[^9]
6. Snooze & drag/deemed consent for non-responding lenders to structural adjustments/affected lender matters in facilities where LENDER1 is a lender.[^10]
7. Prospective lenders before becoming lender under the credit agreement (found in the “pro forma required lenders” formulation) may vote on an amendment or waiver.[^11]
8. MAE language has “merger agreement” type carve-outs which require that an event  disproportionately affect the borrower.[^12]
9. Lack of affirmative covenant to provide notices for Default.
10. The existence of a Default should prohibit any borrowing of loans- i.e, there should be no ability to borrow any loans if a Default is continuing.[^13]
11. (a) Guarantee that expressly releases a guarantor of its obligations to perform under the guarantee in the event of act(s) of war, hostilities, or escalation(s) of such act(s) of war or hostilities or any Force Majeure clauses.
(b) the MAE or MAC definition in a credit agreement expressly carves out act(s) of war, hostilities, or escalation(s) of such act(s) of war or hostilities.
12. A change of control or dilution of the original shareholder/sponsor’s control over the borrower’s voting shares is allowed through:
(a) any formulation of CoC that deviates from the standard loans-type CoC language that requires existing shareholders at the time of closing to maintain economic and voting control of the Borrower, or (b) the insertion exceptions to the concept “change of control” such as “permitted change of control” provisions.

13. Consent to assign or to enter into participations of a loan required from multiple PE sponsors.
For Participations or Assignments any of the following four formulations exist in the documentation: (i) Consent rights to assignments or to voting participations (if any consent rights) do not fall away upon payment or bankruptcy Events of Default of the Borrower or any Guarantor, (ii) non-voting participations require either the consent of, or notice to, the borrower and/or Sponsor (if this is a Sponsor-owned company), (iii) there is no “not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed” language that qualifies the borrower’s consent rights for any facilities expected to trade in secondary, or deemed consent language or (iv) the “Disqualified Institutions” list requires the Administrative Agent or the lenders to identify the institutions that are either competitors of the borrower or institutions that are disqualified because they are engaged in mezzanine lending, private equity, “loan to own”, etc. without listing out the entity names.
14. “Excluded Matter/Permitted Transaction” type carve-outs which expressly include items such as “anything related to any pandemic, epidemic, natural disaster (including fire, flood and storm and related events), act(s) of war, terrorism, hostilities or escalation(s) of such act(s) of war, terrorism or hostilities, strike/industrial action, cyber-attack, act of god or force majeure events” (A) resulting in an inability to trigger an EoD and/or draw stop new drawings, as a consequence of such events and/or (B otherwise result in defaults arising therefrom to be regarding as “permitted actions”.
15. Allow loans under the facility to be subordinated via a “Serta” structure (whereby the exchanged debt obtains priority over certain assets) or similar structure without giving all lenders the ability to participate in the new facility whether through a debt for debt exchange or otherwise.[^14]

## Category 4: Impact on Collateral Protection

1. Ability to pay dividends without reference to baskets or ratios (excluding customary items such as (a) tax distributions and (b) payment conditions for ABL credit facilities). Outside counsel to note potential mitigants such as the presence of an effective maintenance covenant (like a Total Net Leverage) when determining if elevation is required.[^15]
Specify if Dividends permitted by the Transactions with Affiliates covenant are qualified with formulations like “if certified by an independent financial advisor (not to be materially less favorable than if on an arm’s length basis or fair from a financial point of view) or if certified by an independent financial advisor.
2. Ability to make unlimited investments in unrestricted subsidiaries without reference to baskets or ratios or any other cap.
3. Available Amount for dividends or investments in unrestricted subsidiaries grows with the proceeds of (i) any asset sale not subject to the sweep (as opposed to growing only with proceeds of asset sales subject to the asset sale sweep but retained by the borrower due to the application of leveraged-based step downs) or (ii) permitted indebtedness.
4. Language requiring/allowing the Admin Agent (without lender vote) to subordinate existing liens in favor of any other permitted creditors (excluding debt expressly permitted to be senior and  other customary  exceptions such as permitted dispositions or other similar permitted transactions).[^16]
5. Express permission in the restricted payments covenant to service debt incurred at the Holdco level (whether or not such debt is (a) guaranteed at the Opco level or (b) PIK) unless limited to (x) debt that could have been incurred at the Opco level and (y) the proceeds of such debt have been down-streamed to the Opco.
6. Ability to partially or totally PIK (including PIK toggle constructs) interest payments in Direct Lending underwrites and portfolio holds as well as in any other loan LENDER1 holds for investment with PIK features outside the Direct Lending portfolio. This excludes any underwrite of preferred equity for distribution.
7. Absence of bankruptcy or payment default blocker for restricted payments made under the available amount and/or builder baskets or other material RP basket (no need to escalate for small baskets).
For ABL Credit Facilities – additional (non-standard) RP or RDP baskets not subject to bankruptcy or payment default blockers and in addition to payment conditions.
8. No limitations on maturity date or weighted average life to maturity for ratio-based debt baskets (such as ratio debt, incremental debt, incremental equivalent debt/side car debt and acquisition debt baskets).
    - Identify incremental debt that can mature before maturity date of existing facilities.
9. Ability to add to incremental pari capacity by paying down junior, unsecured or subordinated debt.
10. For ABL Credit Facilities, ability to incur pari or senior liens on ABL priority collateral outside of standard permitted encumbrances, agreed intercreditor/subordination terms, or fully reserving for the obligations.
11. Language requiring the Admin Agent to enter into intercreditor agreements in respect of any permitted debt without a Required Lender vote (which could be read to require subordination to any and all permitted debt) or without having negotiated a form of intercreditor in advance.
12. Identify ability to incur debt secured by assets not part of our collateral at the borrower or guarantor level.

## Category 5: Other Risk

1. No immediate Event of Default for loss of lien or priority due to a carveout that is broader than a loss of possessory collateral or failure to file UCC continuation statements or the language implies that the Admin Agent, if LENDER1CB is the Admin Agent, or lenders had an obligation to file continuation statements or take or not take an action in their control.  In any event, the loss of collateral should still constitute a Default and bar any borrowing under a Revolver or DDTL tranche.
  - Flag any language that generally acts as a carveout to an EoD due to acts or failure to act by Admin Agent, Collateral Agent or a lender.
2. No (or very limited) sanctions representation from borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (i.e. lack of either or both of the no-sanctioned person representation or use of proceeds undertaking from borrower)
3. Borrower’s obligation to pay P&I subject to receipt of notice/invoice from Admin Agent calculating the amount due or language permitting the borrower to pay an amount “in good faith” or negating a Default or Event of Default as a result of paying the amount on a statement provided by the Admin Agent. Note: if LENDER1C is agent speak to internal Legal if borrower is pressing on the issue for potential compromise language).[^17]
4. Ability to request KYC information only available up to the date of commitment paper signing or additional information limited to changes in rules and regulations.

Flowchart view of Principles for evaluating Cured Default provisions:

### Step 1: Breadth – please select the appropriate option in this row and specify the provision you are looking at

Any and All Events of Default are curable|More than one Event of Default is curable, but formulation excludes certain Events of Default, such as financial maintenance covenant, misrepresentation breaches or breaches of loan mechanics sections. [^18]|Cure of a specific Event of Default only (e.g., only failure to provide notice of default timely is curable, or only cross-default is curable)|

### Step 2: Carveouts - please select the appropriate option in this row and specify the provision you are looking at

Carveout for knowledge[^19]|Other carveouts|

### Step 3: Other Factors (do any exist?)

  - Cure after acceleration/commencement of other remedies or declaration of an Event of Default
      - Explicit language permitting Event of Default cures to be available post-acceleration/commencement of other remedies
  - Number of precedents with same Borrower/Sponsor when LENDER1C is lead bank
  - ABL credit agreements – Does language act to cure breaches of affirmative covenants related to the borrowing base certificate and related deliverables?

## Further Detail on Flowchart

### Proposed Cured Defaults Framework

Now that over five years have passed since “cured default” provisions first started appearing in credit agreements, we believe it is time to reframe the analysis and focus on some key principles that lawyers and credit officers should consider when analyzing proposed formulations with both sponsors and corporate borrowers.  The below includes proposed key “principles” alongside a proposed rating of each under the current Certain Credit Terms framework (the “CCT framework”), and ends with excerpts of certain cured default provisions seen in the market.
Note, we do not deem broadly and vaguely drafted formulations that simply state “an event of default may be cured” to constitute a “cured default” provision for purposes of this framework.  If a provision does not provide a roadmap for curing the events of default, then it is our position that the events of default under the credit agreement in question are only curable via the already specified cured methods, such as the equity cure, payment of default interest or obtaining a waiver from the requisite lenders (as applicable).

### Principles for Evaluating

  - The breadth of the cured default formulation:
      - Does the formulation suggest that any and all Events of Default under the Credit Agreement are curable?
      - Does the formulation pick up more than one but not all of the Events of Default?  For examples, some formulations appear to provide cures for all negative covenant breaches and certain affirmative covenant breaches only (but not a breach of a financial maintenance covenant, misrepresentation breaches or breaches of most “loan mechanics” provisions of the credit agreement)[^20].
      - Does the formulation only relate to the cure of a specific Event of Default, such as solely a failure to provide a notice of default in a timely manner or a cross-default?
−   If YES, this would not be picked up as a “broad cured default” under the CCT framework.
  - Effectiveness of the carve-outs to the cured default formulation:
      - Does the formulation include a carve-out for failure to deliver a notice of default despite actual knowledge of the underlying default (whether initial or subsequent) by Responsible Officers of the Borrower?  Note that this carveout may vary in specificity/breadth and so please do provide the exact language.
− Does the knowledge qualifier include language indicating that the failure to provide notice of the Default or Event of Default must be deliberate or intentional?
−      If YES,  while strong efforts should be made to revise so there is no intentionality included in the carveout, this less preferred knowledge qualifier will still be considered a carveout for knowledge for purposes of the CCT.
      - Does the formulation include different carve-outs that either alone or in combination are deemed sufficiently protective by the counsel and credit officer working on the matter?
−    As an illustration, while the other carve-outs we have seen in the other agreed formulations with Sponsors and Corporate borrowers have not been deemed to be sufficiently effective at limiting the breadth of the proposed cured default formulations, there may be instances where the sheer number of such additional carve-outs may warrant a reduction in the level of escalation.  Similarly, there may be carve-outs that have not yet been agreed to in current cured default precedents that warrant such a reduction in the level of escalation, such as a carve-out that requires the lenders not to have suffered any losses as a result of the default and cure.
  - Other factors
      - Cures after acceleration/other remedies
−   Does the formulation specifically allow an Event of Default to be cured after an acceleration by the Lenders or other remedies have been exercised?
      - Precedent with same Borrower/Sponsor when acting as lead bank
−   Has the same cured default formulation been agreed to with this same Borrower/Sponsor where LENDER1C was the lead bank? If YES, please note the precedent to Credit and internal counsel.
      - ABL credit agreements
−    Does the cured default formulation cover breaches of affirmative covenants related to the borrowing base certificate and related deliverables?

[^1]: Springing covenants do not need to be reported.
[^2]: Example: minimum equity check of 30% in the commitment papers, buyer ends up contributing a 50% equity check, the difference of 20% over the minimum equity requirement cannot be used for future equity cures.
For the avoidance of doubt, equity injected after the closing date but prior to a financial covenant breach that remains unused/not otherwise applied can be allocated to cure a financial covenant breach and not require engagement.
[^3]: if an addback for new contracts is permitted on a look-forward basis, then it may result in an aggressive revenue synergy.
[^4]: Amendments made to Article 11 of Regulation S-X in 2021 give management more discretion to include cost-savings and synergies in pro forma financials for acquisitions and dispositions.  As a result, an aggressive private company could take advantage of this change to effectively overwrite any caps on consolidated EBITDA to the extent such calculations of consolidated EBITDA are made after excluding amounts taken in compliance with Regulation S-X.
[^5]: Example: Assets are first moved to an unrestricted subsidiary and are then sold.  Sale proceeds are then transferred to the restricted group as a cash dividend and are counted as income.
[^6]: If compliance with the incurrence test is tested at the time of incurrence, then the incurrence ratio should account for the DDTL commitment as if it had been fully drawn (pro forma to use of proceeds with no cash netting).
If compliance with the incurrence test is deferred to the time of drawdown then the incurrence ratio should account for all funded DDTL on the drawdown date (pro forma to use of proceeds with no cash netting).
Concern is that a Borrower who could only incur $50mm of first lien debt in compliance with its incurrence ratio may obtain $50mm in undrawn commitments on day 1, an additional $50mm of undrawn commitments on day 2 (without taking into account the undrawn commitments obtained on day 1), etc.

[^7]: If grower baskets are linked to other applicable metrics different from EBITDA, e.g. Consolidated Total Assets or Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, please note this and indicate whether this is market standard..
[^8]: These provisions would typically either remove voting rights from, or otherwise bar from the lender group (typically via inclusion in a “Disqualified Institution” concept) any lenders who are “net short” as a result of various credit default swap or other positions held by the lender.  The lack of (i) a carveout for affiliates means that the Asset Wealth Management group and LENDER1organ Chase Funding Inc. or any other LENDER1 affiliate which becomes a lender and is not a regulated bank would be subject to the net short language and would need to consider the swap positions of it and all of it
[^9]: Sacred Rights” provisions that require “all lender” or “affected lender” amendments include:
a.     Increase in commitments, reductions in principal amounts, interest rates or payment amounts to be made under the credit agreement (including fees, amortization payments, interest payments, etc.),
b.     postponement of payment dates (but not amendments to the timing of mandatory prepayments),
c.     extension of maturity dates,
d.     modifications to the definition of “Required/Majority/Super Majority Lenders”, “Structural Adjustment” (or similar terms) or changes to the amendment thresholds included in the voting and amendments section of the credit agreement,
e.     release of all or substantially all of the collateral or value of guarantees,
f.      modifications to the “pro rata” sharing provisions,
g.     modifications to the Events of Default payment waterfall.

[^10]: Snooze & Drag – provides that lenders who do not actively respond to a request to consent to an amendment within the specified time period given to respond shall be deemed to have consented to the amendment and as such could be dragged into the amendment.  Primarily seen in amend/extend transactions to accommodate CLOs who may be unable to actively vote.
Contrast with Snooze & Lose – provides that lenders who do not actively respond to a request to consent to an amendment within the specified time period given to respond will not have their commitments counted in the denominator of the fractional calculation determining whether majority, super-majority or all lender consent has been reached.
[^11]: Example:  Lenders whose commitments do not yet exist at the time of voting including 1) new commitments raised as part of an amendment and extension where lenders of such new commitments are entitled to vote before actually committing to the amendment and extension and 2) lenders that replace/yank non-consenting lenders without having acquired the commitments subject to the yank.
[^12]: “Merger Agreement” carveouts are those found in a purchase and sale agreement and typically limit the ability to call a MAE on the target by carving out certain business events which do not qualify as a MAE.
[^13]: Rollover requests of existing drawn loans can be subject to no EoD or other more lenient constructs.
This applies only to new money drawdowns that are not subject to Sungard or similar certain funds provisions or to standard limited condition transactions (LCTs)
For ABL Credit Facilities, note if carveouts are broader than “best interest” fundings or Agent’s discretion to continue funding may not be revoked by the Required Lenders.
[^14]: Serta: Normally lenders expect that a key “sacred right” includes the requirement that all lenders must be treated equally in regards to security and collateral protection. However, in this transaction, the Borrower used Borrower buy-back provisions that are a carve-out of the “pro-rata sharing of payments” provision of the secured credit agreement to effectuate a debt-for-debt exchange with certain of the existing secured lenders, which had the result of allowing those participating lender to “prime,” or structurally get ahead of, the secured lenders who chose not to participate in the debt-for-debt exchange in regards to the security package. The Borrower was able to effectively create a “super priority” lender group from its existing secured lender group without the permission of those lenders that did not consent (and whom normally would expect to have the right to reject such a restructuring).  The credit agreement did not contain a flat prohibition on subordination without an affected lender vote.
[^15]: Note that if unlimited dividends appear to be permitted under the Transactions with Affiliates covenant, one should confirm that such dividends are also permitted under the Restricted Payments covenant.
[^16]: Example: A provision which provides that Assets that are not pledged because they fall within a permitted lien basket does not need to be flagged.
[^17]: This item should also be approved by operations.
[^18]: Language specifying that any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (i) the failure by any Credit party to take any action is cured at the time that such action is taken or (ii) the taking of any action by any Credit Party that is not then permitted by the terms of this Agreement or any other Credit Document is cured on the earlier to occur of (x) the date on which such action would be permitted and (y) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to be permitted is deemed to cure only affirmative covenants and negative covenants only.
[^19]: Note that some forms of the knowledge qualifier are preferred over others.  While strong efforts should be made to revise a knowledge qualifier that has language indicating that failure to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default was deliberate or intentional so that there is no intentionality included, this less preferred knowledge qualifier will still be considered a carveout for knowledge for purposes of the CCT.
[^20]: The language relating to cure of a default existing due to “failure to take an action by a specified time” appears to only relate to a small subset of affirmative covenants that contain a temporal element, which include the covenants for delivery of financial statements, compliance certificate, payment of taxes, further assurances and post-closing obligations.
[^21]: Although the CA includes RPs, investments and JDPs within the same covenant, this summary breaks these out separately for ease of comparison against the separate covenants in typical credit agreements.
