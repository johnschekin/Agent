## Term-by-Term Guidance

[PRIVATE CREDIT HOT BUTTON ITEMS; COMPARISON TO BANK-SIDE LENDER TRANSACTIONS]

Current as of [       ], 2024

#### The below outline is intended to be a summary of:

- key recurring hot button items found in private credit loan (“PCL”) transactions and
- noteworthy differences relative to broadly syndicate loan (“BSL”) transactions.

As in the BSL market, terms will differ not only based onmarket conditions but also the size of the borrower and whether it is a sponsor portfolio company and whether that sponsor is considered to be an active top-tier sponsor (“TTS”). TTS  in regular way transactions may be afforded more favorable treatment relative to other borrowers/sponsors and in those instances we have noted the differences. The below is not intended to be all encompassing and reflects our view on market standards as of the date of this presentation.

Private credit transactions are generally divided into three categories:

Lower Middle Market (“LMM”): Borrowers with EBITDA less than $50 million
Core Middle Market (“CMM”): Borrowers with EBITDA between $50 and $100 million
Upper Middle Market/Upmarket (“UMM”): Borrowers with EBITDA greater than $100 million.
BSL Replacement: UM This category would also cover PC transactions that compete with the BSL market (“BSLR”)

Where appropriate we have noted current market terms for each of the LMM, CMM, UM and BSL categories and within each have identified Conservative, Typical and Aggressive Terms

### 1. Key Definitions

#### Applicable Margin:

- Leverage based step-downs: One or two 25bps stepdowns not atypical
- IPO stepdown: Will sometimes see an additional 25bps step-down post IPO in TTS transactions.

#### Asset Sales:

- Cap dispositions to non-Loan Parties (cap typically shared with non-Loan Party Investments and intercompany debt baskets)
- Securitizations: Typically capped and avoid “all asset” securitization provisions
- Sale-leasbacks
  - Typically capped other than Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions
- Reject unlimited leveraged based asset sale basket
- 75% test:
  - 75% cash requirement
    - UMM/BLS: Typically still per transaction but may be cumulative in Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions (but include a minimum of 50% cash per transaction)
  - 75% Threshold
    - UMM/BSLR: Typically 5-10% of EBITDA
    - CMM/LMM: No threshold or max 5%
  - FMV Requirement
    - Standard in all PCLs
  - EOD Stopper
    - UMM/BSLR: Aggressive deals with have a payment or bktcy EOD stopper or no stopper
    - Otherwise full EOD stopper

#### Available Amount

- Starter:
  - UMM/BSLR: Aggressive 40-50% EBITDA; Otherwise 10-30%
  - CMM/LMM Typically 5-25% EBITDA
- Builder:
  - Typically Retained ECF based but for UMM/BSLR transactions may also be 50% ofCNI.
    - Retained ECF should only be increased by retained percentage of ECF and not the net ECF unswept amount
    - De minimis deductible should not build Retained ECF (but often given in Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions)
    - Dollar for dollar deducts to mandatory prepayment for voluntary prepaymentsetc should not build Retained ECF
- Typically will reject retained asset sale proceeds building Available Amount other than transactions with asset sale percentage stepdown
- Typically will seek to cap returns on investment type baskets to amount of original investment
  - Avoid allowing for double counting returns (ieunresticted sub investment made with a non Available Amount  investment basket but returned value builds Available Amount) but often given in Aggressive UMM/BSLRtransactions
  - Include “not otherwise applied language” throughout agreement to avoid double counting (eg, equity contributions)
- Usage:
  - Starter Basket and Non Grower Prongs
    - UMM/BSLR: Aggressive often no EOD stopper (or limited to bktcy/payment EOD stopper) or Leverage Test;
    - CMM/LMM:  Typically full EOD stopper and Leverage Test
  - Grower Prong:
    - UMM/BSLR: Typically full EOD stopper but in Aggressive deals RJDPs may be subject to payment/bktcy EOD stopper and RIs may be have no stopper at all
  - Pro Forma Total Leverage test:
    - Typically a Total Leverage test even in Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR:
- RPs: Closing TLR
- RJDPs: Closing TLR
- RIs: Typically no leverage condition
    - CMM/LMM:
- RPs: Typically 0.75-1.0 inside closing TLR/ Aggressive 0.5-0.75x inside
- RJDPs: Typically 0.5-0.75 inside/ Aggressive 0.5 inside
- Restricted Investments: Typically Closing TRL/Aggressive no condition or subject to Financial Covenant

#### Change of Control:

- Portability is unlikely to be accepted. If present, flag for Clients. Portability should include
  - Min AUM or list of IDed sponsors
  - Permitted Jurisdiction, not sanctioned
  - Full KYC
  - Min equity contribution
  - Pro forma compliance with Leverage Ratio
  - Default Stopper
  - Only 1 permitted
  - With [24] months of  close
  - Officer’s certificate

- Permitted Holders:
  - Flag if definition includes features like
    - Any investor at close is a Permitted Holder
    - Sponsor definition broader that Controlled Affiliates or includes portcos.
    - Unlimited  management inclusion
    - Loose “group” definitions
    - Below majority ownership pre-ipo

#### EBITDA

- Clients very focused on the quality of EBITDA and abuses in addbacks (ie a hot button for Clients):
  - Compensation expense addback should be limited to “non-cash” items or if cash must be funded with qualified equity not otherwise applied; highlight loose language that could permit cash comp expense/creative bonus payments (including phantom equity payments) to be added back
  - Extraordinary/unusual losses/reorg and restructuring expenses:
    - Highlight for Clients and try to cap either separately or shared cap with run-rate cost savings
  - Run Rate Cost Savings
    - UMM/BSLR: Aggressive cap at 30-355 and 18-24 month look forward
    - CMM/LMM: Typically 20-30% and 12-18 look forward
  - Run Rate Revenue/EBITDA/New Stores/New Contracts or Pricing and Revenue Synergies Items:
    - Clients very sensitive to this and will likely reject
    - Will be deal/sponsor specific and Clients will likely be looking for most conservative language option if they accept at all
    - Reject Covid type lost revenue/EBITDA addbacks
    - See Attached Exhibit XX with some examples.
  - QofE: Clients may resist but often accepted. Generally try to limit to Big 4 accounting firm and only in connection with Acquisitions and provide that any items that are covered by capped addback must be capped
  - S-X: limit to pre amendment provision or tie into one of the capped baskets
  - Caps:
    - Ideally caps will be calculated before and not after giving effect to the addback
    - Caps are often shared among run rate, extraordinary, litigation, other
    - Run rate revenues etc may have their own smaller cap which may also be part of the larger cap (e 15% but eats into the 30% cap)
  - Reject “of the type” language

#### Indebtedness

- Other than in Aggressive UMM/BSLR deals (which tend to match BSLs) earnouts should always be debt for the negative covenant (with a corresponding basket; measured at maximum possible obligation per the relevant agreement) and debt for the leverage ratios if due and payable or alternatively past due by more than 5/30 days

First Lien/Secured/Total Leverage Ratios
- Clients still include borrowed money, cap leases, purchase money, evidenced by notes, unreimbursed LCs earnouts if [due and payable/past due/past due by 5/30 or more days] and disqualified stock where appropriate
  - For 1L and Secured Leverage should include all debt secured by a lien and not limited to a lien on Collateral
  - Discuss cap on cash netting
  - Discuss whether DACAs apply and if so limit netting toDaca cash
  - Flag for Clients if Borrower permitted to net proceeds of issuance from incurrence test (eg if used to replenish cash etc)

Aggressive UMM/BSL transactions will likely match theBSL market here

#### Interest Coverage Ratio (if relevant)

  - Should include PIK interest and not just cash pay

#### Required Lenders

If Client is a  minority lender may want to ask that Required Lenders also have the “two or more unaffiliated lenders” prong.

### 2. Article 2

#### Funding Deadlines:

- Confirm if PC Client agency/ops team or third party agent/sub agent will review the CA generally
- Confirm deadlines for notices to Agent and Lenders. Many Clients use lines of credit and notice and funding deadlines must sync up

#### Delayed Draw Term Loans

- Typically limited to Permitted Acquisitions but you sometimes see growth cap ex as well; if replenishing cash used typically must be within 30-60 days; Confirm with Clients
- Conditions would include
  - Pro Forma closing leverage (discuss with client whether stacking or excluding concurrent revolver draws permissible)
  - prior notice
  - max number of draws
  - min amount
  - No Default or Event of Default
  - Accuracy of Reps (subject to LCT)
- Typically at 18 month commitment; occasionally 24 months
- Ticking Fee typically 1%
- Commitment/Funding Fee: typically same % as initial term loans but split 50% upfront and 50% with each funding; some Clients try to get second 50% at termination of commitments (ie, if unused)

#### Interest

- PIK Interest: Extremely rare in PC 1L transactions; may see if 2Ls occasionally; Typically in sub debt; Holdco Loans typically all PIK or PIK/Toggle
  - Some PIK Terms
    - Cap on amount of margin that can be PIKed/ Min cash interest condition in each period
    - Limits on number of PIK periods/window during which PIK can be used
    - Increase in rate when PIK is used
    - Limits on PIK tied to use of RP basket
    - How to calculate make-whole relative to future interest payments
    - Whether prepayment premium is due on capitalized PIK
- Calculation of default interest:
  - UMM/BSLR: Will match the BSL market (ietriggered by bktcy/payment EOD only and increase only on past due amounts)
  - CMM/LMM: In Aggressive deals will matchBSL terms; otherwise trigger is any EOD and increase is on entire loan

#### LCs

- Confirm whether Clients can do commercial LCs and foreign currency LCs
- Confirm who LC issuer will be. Clients often contract it out to third parties so LC Issuer definition may need to reflect that.

#### Swingline Loans/Same Day Base Rate

- Ask Clients if they have capacity to do this. Many manage cash flow using lines of credit and may have limitations.

#### Incremental Facilities

- Starter
  - 75-100% with 100% fairly standard.
  - Typically no reallocation from general debt, general RP, general RDP or general investment baskets
    - In Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions may give general debt basket
- Avoid up-tiering for voluntary prepayment prong; credit only for amounts paid
- No worse prongs:
  - Very atypical even in Aggressive UMM/BSLRtransactions; if agreed limit it to acquisitions
- Interest coverage test:
  - Typically rejected
- Leverage levels:
  - set at equivalent closing level; no headroom other than occasionally up to 0.25x for junior lien debt and 0.25-0.50x for unsecured debt
- Incremental debt secured by non-Collateral:
  - Typically reject even in Aggressive UMM/BSLR
- Non-Loan Party Incremental Capacity:
  - Typically reject even in Aggressive UMM/BSLR
- MFN:
  - Sunset
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: 12-18 months
    - Otherwise no sunset
  - 50 bps standard even for Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions
  - Capped Amount
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: Up to 50% of EBITDA
    - Otherwise none
  - Applies to:
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: pari term loans only (no syndication requirement; may have currency requirement)
    - Otherwise all pari debt including debt securities and IED, Ratio debt, incurred acquisition debt and any other ratio baskets; discuss general debt basket (espif permitted to be a pari lien)
  - Outside maturity exception
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: 12-18 months
    - Otherwise no exception

#### o

  - Acquisition exception
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: Even here very rare
  - Use conservative definition of All In Yield
- Maturity/WALM: would also apply to IED, Ratio Debt, incurred acquisition debt etc
  - Avoid inside maturity exception other than customary bridges and escrow arrangements
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: may give a basket up to 50-100% of EBITDA
- Terms either same as existing or market at the time with typical protections (same as BSL)
- Existing Lender ROFR:
  - Atypical in Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions
  - Common in CMM and LMM transactions
  - Otherwise ask Clients if they want to raise as they may have precedents with sponsor withROFR
- Other Terms:
  - Generally same/similar to BSL transactions.Flexilibity will depend on deal dynamics

- 

#### Voluntary/Mandatory Prepayments

#### Call Protection:

- Hard call is standard. Rarely see soft call. Applies to voluntary, debt sweep, yank a bank AND acceleration (Aggressive UMM/BSL transactions may not include acceleration).
  - 1Ls: typically 2/1/0
  - 2Ls: typically 3/2/1/0 or NC-1/2/1/0
- Exceptions
  - Occasionally reduced (eg 2/1/0 becomes 1/0) premium or no premium for repayment in connection with Change of Control or IPO but not for Transformative Acquisitions etc
    - Clients in an LBO esp those that buy co-invest equity more likely to give the CofC and IPO exceptions since typically unlikely to sell the company that quickly and an exit/ipo would likely result in gains on their equity investment
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: occasionally (but not often) may see additional exceptions to the call premium consistent with BSL soft call protections (ie, transformation dispositions, non permitted acquisitions , ipo, change of control)

#### Asset Sale Sweep:

- Baskets Covered
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: Typically limited to the unlimited sales basket (ie the  75% basket)
  - Otherwise: Should apply to 75%, general, sale leaseback, de minimis, non-core and other material asset sale baskets
- Threshold:
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: 5-15% per transaction; sometimes also an annual cap 10-20% per year
  - Otherwise: 5-10% per transaction/per year
- Leverage based step downs are extremely rare even in Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions (but there are examples and depends on the deal dynamic (some go to 50/0 others 75/50/0)
- Should apply to all Restricted Subs not just Loan Parties and to all assets not just Collateral
- Reinvestment period
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: 450/540 days plus 180
  - Otherise: 360 plus 180

- Unlimited ability to sell non-Collateral: a hot button: Will likely reject or add parameters like EofD stopper, fmv, sweep.
- Unlimited ratio based asset sales basket: Reject
- Carryback of proceeds to prior investment: Flag, PC Client will likely reject or add short time period (eg 60-120 days)
- EOD Blocker on reinvestment:
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: Typically none
  - Otherwise: Clients likely to push for this.

#### Excess Cash Flow Sweep

- Discuss with Clients implication of dollar for dollar deducts for cap ex, investments, rps etc
- Identify size of de minimis threshold
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: typically between 5-10% of EBITDA
  - Otherwise: non or no more than 5%
- Leveraged based step downs
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR:  typically 0.5 and 1.0 inside closing first lien leverage (for a 1L deal)
  - Otherwise: 0.5x/1.0x or 0.75x/1.5x inside closing total/first lien/secured leverage.

#### Amend and Extend/Refi

  - Make Clients aware if not most conservative version of language
  - Would wont offers to be pro rata

### 3. Conditions Precedent

#### [ANYTHING TO ADDRESS HERE?]

### 4. Affirmative Covenants

- Financials:
  - Annuals
    - 120 days is typically (150  in first year)

- Designation of Unrestricted Subs
  - Envision Protection: Not universal but some Clients will push to limit investments in Unrestricted Subs to certain baskets per Envision.
  - Conditions to Designation:
    - EOD stopper: Standard to include; Some Aggressive UMM/BSLR may limit tobktcy/payment EOD
    - Investment Capacity: Standard to include
    - Leverage Condition: None in Aggressive UMM/BSLR. Otherwise would be pro forma compliance with Financial Covenant (if there is one) and in more conservative CMM/LMM deals may be Closing Total Leverage.
  - Required Designation under other Debt Documents
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: Often absent
    - Otherwise: typical
  - Identify if agreement permits loan party credit support for Unrestricted Subs (ie guarantees) or if Unrestricted Subs can be creditors of the Restricted Group (ie double dip intercompany loans)
  - In tighter non Aggressive UMM/BSLRtransactions may seek overall cap on assets andEbitda of Unrestricted Subs in the 5-10% range.

### 5. Negative Covenants

#### General Note:

- Baskets will include EBITDA growers but typically tighter than syndicated deals.
  - Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions will typically max out in the 40-50% range (similar to BSL) but currently with greater emphasis on tightening baskets that avoid leakage and present LME risk
  - CMM/LMM:  Baskets generally in range of 10-25/30% range.
- Clients generally prefer EOD stoppers on the baskets that would ordinarily have them and not payment/bktcystoppers esp RP and incurrence basket baskets.
- Chewy: Typically include tighter formulation
  - Require investment capacity for FMV of  released guarantor
  - Sale of equity to a non affiliate and/or bona fide business purpose (other than incurring the debt or lien)
  - Avoid automatic release; require Agent action
  - If foreign Sub voluntarily guaranteed and seeks release add EOD stopper
  - Ask discuss whether to require that at the time of release that released sub cannot be guarantor of incremental/equivalent debt, ratio debt, incurred acquisition debt or refi debt

- Leakage:
  - Preference is Total Leverage Ratio not First Lien or Secured for incurrence based tests (but with exceptions for Aggressive UMM/BSLR as noticed in this deck)
  - Retain EOD stoppers
  - Reject “non worse than” tests
  - Available Amount Usage: See “Available Amount” above
  - Unlimited Baskets: See RPs, RDPs and Investments below
  - Reallocation:
    - Typically limited to reallocating from RPs to RDPs/Investments  and RDPs to Investments but not  the other way
    - Other than in Aggressive UMM/BSLRtransactions, reject reallocations to build debt capacity
    - Otherwise limit to within same covenant
  - Stacking/Phony Ratio
    - Clients will consider excluding concurrent revolver draws but will reject excluding revolver outstandings altogether
    - Ideally limited to ratios for debt incurrence baskets and not for RPs, RDPs or RIs

- Double Dip: Require that intercompany debt owed by Loan Parties to non-Loan Parties is subordinated to the PC Client debt
- High Water Mark:
  - Greater of actual closing and hardwired leverage levels: Reject
  - Greater of pro forma EBITDA and highest previous reported EBITDA: Reject

- Indebtedness:
  - IED and Ratio Debt:
    - MFN will generally apply in all transactions including Aggressive UMM/BSLR
    - Non-Guarantor Cap will generally apply in all transactions including Aggressive UMM/BSLR
    - WALM/Maturity/Inside maturity carveouts: Aggressive UMM/BSLR may not have these protections (or a cap on inside maturing debt); otherwise Clients will expect these protections
    - No worse and FCCR prongs typically rejected including in UMM/BSLRtransactions
  - Sale-leaseback debt:
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: Often uncapped
    - Otherwise: capped
  - Securitization Debt:
    - Typically capped in all transactions
    - Avoid “all asset” securitizations
  - Seller Debt:
    - Typically capped in all transactions
    - CMM/LMM: may require subordination terms and other acceptable terms (not cash pay, no covs, later maturity; at Holdco)
  - Earnouts:
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: If not “Indebtedness” no cap
    - Otherwise: Capped, subordinated and acceptable terms
  - Intercompany loans to non-Loan Parties capped/shared baskets with investments in non Loan Parties
    - Loan Party debt owed to non- Loan party should be unsecured and subordinated
  - RP debt baskets
    - Reject; sometimes found in Aggressive UMM/BSLR transactions
  - Contribution debt:
    - Flag for Client
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: typically 100% and  unsecured with outside date for incurrence
  - Focus on non Loan-Party debt and general debt capacity in particular structurally senior debt and debt secured by non-Collateral and ability to bring in more pari secured debt not subject to closing 1L leverage.

- Liens
  - Avoid having both a general liens basket and a crossing lien to general debt basket

- Investments
  - Cap non-Loan Party Investments ( in CMM/LMM may be a shared cap with intercompany debt and asset sales)
  - Clients prefer to get an Envision blocker but not a must  have in UMM/BSLR transactions
  - J Crew protections standard. Correct any Trap Door provisions. Also get “non-exclusive” for licenses; try to block material IP transfers to non-guarantors if possible (and not just to Unrestricted Subs)
  - Raise with client size of Unrestricted Sub basket and other baskets and highlight for client the other baskets (eg,similar business, jv etc if applicable)(Clients will want to look at them in their totality)
  - Ratio Investments:
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: 0.5-1.0x inside closing leverage (may be TLR or FLR) and no payment/bktcy EOD
    - CMM/LMM: 0.5-1.5x inside closing leverage and either no EOD or no payment/bktcy EOD (0.5x-1.5x inside the leverage level used for the AA Builder basket)

- Restricted Payments (“RP”)
  - Raise with Clients ability to dividend Unrestricted Subs
    - This is considered leakage and can be round tripped to build contribution debt or other RP capacity.
    - Will likely be rejected even in Aggressive UMM/BSLR; as a compromise discuss blocking cash cow Unrestricted Subs
  - Raise with Clients generous tax distribution provisions
    - Clients focused on advantageous treatment to sponsors of ignoring enhanced depreciation/amortization tax deductions from stepped up basis in assets
    - Similarly on straight cross refs to the provisions of an LLC Agreement
  - Management buyback carrybacks and carryforwards:
    - Avoid carry backs and limit carryforwards to one year
    - Include EofD stopper
  - Post-IPO basket: Highlight for client if it’s the sum of proceeds and market cap; may accept this. Highlight if it (1) include post ipo public offering proceeds (should accept that), (2) private issuances (will likely reject) or (3)SPAC provisions (esp those that credit “contributions” to SPAC since those may give credit for value of enterprise)
  - General RP basket and other material RP baskets to be subject to EofD stopper; for TTS Transactions Clients may accept bktcy/payment EoD in some instances
  - Ratio RPs
    - Aggressive UMM: 1.0-1.75x inside closing leverage and EOD stopper
    - CMM/LMM: 1.0-2.5x inside closing leverage and EOD stopper (0.5x-1.5x inside the leverage level used for the AA Builder basket)

    - 

- Restricted Junior Debt Payments (“RDP”)
  - Definition of Restricted Junior Debt: PC client will want it to include sub debt and jr lien debt and, if possible unsecured debt or “material” unsecured debt. Aggressive UMM/BSLR will not include unsecured debt. Make Client aware if otherwise
  - Does covenant block all payments or just prepayments? Principal only? Looser TTS Transactions will be HY style. Discuss with PC Client
  - General basket and other material RDP baskets should be subject to a D/EofD stopper; for TTS Transactions Clients may accept bktcy/payment EoD
  - Do not permit jr debt to be refinanced with senior debt; check Permitted Refinancing definitions and baskets and RJDP baskets
  - Ratio Based:
    - Aggressive UMM: 1.0-1.5x inside closing leverage and EOD stopper
    - CMM/LMM: 1.0-2.25x inside closing leverage and EOD stopper (0.5x-1.5x inside the leverage level used for the AA Builder basket)

#### o

#### o

  - Typically EofD stopper and ProForma Total Leverage equal to 0.50-1.0x inside where the Available Amount level is set at (ie if Available Amount is at 0.50x inside closing leverage then unlimited will be 0.5-1.5x inside)

- Affiliate Transactions
  - Management fees should be capped in the covenant and subject to a D/EoD blocker or for more competitive transactions bktcy/payment EoD blocker.

  - Raise De Minimis threshold with client. Expection is it will be small.
    - Aggressive UMM/BSLR: 5-10% of EBITDA
    - Otherwise: 2.5-5% or none

### 6. Financial Covenant

- Depending on market conditions, transactions for TTS Transactions will likely be Cov Lite where closing EBITDA is in the $60-80+ million range.
- For Cov Lite:
  - Ranges of cushions to sponsor model:35-40% off sponsor model
    - Unlike BSL Clients will not assume revolver is fully drawn when setting the level
  - Tripped when 35-40% drawn
    - Only exclude cash collateralized lcs and perhaps up to $x of non-cash collateralized lcs.
    - Reject request to test usage net of cash
  - Standstill should apply
  - Cures permitted if equity funded during the quarter
- For Full Time Covenant:
  - Typically at a non-cumulative cushion of [30-35]% off sponsor model
  - Should be a Total Leverage Ratio
  - Most likely static but may get 1-2 25bps stepdowns
  - Will have typical cure right.
    - No requirement to pay down  term loan.

### 7. Events of Default

- Cured Defaults: Raise with Clients. In TTS Transactions may accept as long as it’s the tighter formulation.
- Flag references to “and is continuing” or “and continuance” in events of default as may be a back door cure. But will likely accept in TTS Transactions
- Affirmative covenant to provide notice should be on Default not Event of Default
- Statute of Limitations: Typically rejected
- Net Short: Should not be an issue for Clients unless an affiliate of a regulated bank.

#### 8.Admin Agency Provisions

- Ask Clients if they have internal admin/ops team or third party agent/sub-agent reviewing the CA

### 9. Miscellaneous

#### Amendments

- Vote: Clients currently focused on Incora Blockers/Pro Forma Required Lenders votes/Commitments voting
- Sacred Rights:
  - Pro rata payments and sharing/waterfalls must be all lender/all affected lender
    - Avoid “except as otherwise permitted” or “Subject to mandatory prepayments” type language
  - Include all other customary sacred rights protections
- Serta: include strong Serta protection. Clients will likely live with offer to participate but must include on same terms (including fees)
- Reject snooze you lose concept

#### Assignments

- DQ List
  - Reject updating the list other than for competitors
  - Typically expect prohibition on assignments to DQs to fall-away on a payment or bktcy event of default
- Make Clients aware if non pro rata open market purchases/privately negotiated purchases  are permitted or if any other provisions relating to buybacks/assignments to sponsor affiliates are not the tighter versions of these concepts.
  - Require Borrower/subs to cancel debt acquired
  - D/EofD stopper
  - Cap at 25/30%
  - No revolver draw
  - No vote/cap vote at 49.9% for debt fund affiliates
  - Try to cap number of Affiliated Lenders to avoid block on class vote

#### Confidentiality

- Clients often has preferred formulations esp if the invest through a public BDC with related disclosure obligations

### 10. Other Items

Admin Agent Discretion: If one Clients lender is majority of tranche they may want to limit Agent discretion on items (iedeadlines, etc)

#### Security Documents

- Even with TTS Transactions avoid agreeing to advance notice to exercise voting of pledged securities

#### Second Lien Transactions

- Typically cushions on dollar baskets only and not ratios
- Anti-layering: avoid 1.5 lien and require any debt contractually subordinated to 1L to also be to 2L
- Restrict sponsor ability to buy 1L debt

#### Management Rights/VCOC Letters

#### Board Observer

#### Equity Co-Investments

#### Expense Reimbursement

### 11. Commitment Letters
