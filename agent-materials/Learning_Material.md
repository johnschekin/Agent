### 1) Tips for Preparing Issues Lists

**What is the purpose of issues lists?**

- Crystallize issues or provisions that require client attention
- Cull commitment papers that may run 100+ pages to issues list of 3-5 pages
- Save time for our clients
- Used within client for running issues up-the-chain or with specialists (such as agency/operational teams and internal counsel)
- Memorialize issues discussed between us and client
- Even if prepared the draft, issues lists are sometimes helpful to focus client attention on questions we need answered

**When do we use issues lists?**

- Commitment letters
- Credit agreements
- Description of notes
- Other negotiated documentation, like underwriting agreements

In this presentation, we will focus on issues lists for commitment letters, specifically for senior secured credit facilities. We will refer to the commitment parties generically as banks, but commitment parties may include non-bank entities like direct lenders.

**How do you make an issues list useful?**

Identify and **summarize** all important issues:
- Do not repeat long text from the letters unless important to describe the issue (sometimes paste and then summarize so you dont inadvertently get a number wrong)

Make the issues list comprehensible on a stand-alone basis:
- State the issue and if the potential risks are not obvious, describe such potential risks and mitigating factors, if any
- Assume client will not read the commitment papers in the same detail as lawyers
- Some clients prefer to respond to issues lists only by email, so we may not have opportunity to explain the issue by phone

DQ lenders include:
i. known or reasonably identifiable (on the basis of name) affiliates of lenders on the DQ list. Consistent with Amber.
ii. competitors identified from time to time. Consistent with Amber.

**Clear market:**
(1) includes exception for any indebtedness issued in lieu of the Facilities or the Interim Facilities, which makes the clear market meaningless
(2) also exception for separately committed bridge (or notes issued in lieu thereof); current engagement letter does not cover notes issued in lieu thereof

Take into account any business terms that have already been agreed:
- Do not raise terms that were in any grid or key terms term sheet that were agreed by the bank
- **Exception:** If we were not involved in the grid or key terms stage, and we want to confirm a provision because it seems questionable in some way, or we have become aware of new information

**DO** raise provisions that were changed from the grid:
- **Exception:** No need to raise changes that are better for the banks, unless it would be helpful for the banks to know the improvement in terms (for example, as part of a **quid pro quo**)

**Examples:**
- Commitment period – tied to the Long Stop Date in the Acquisition Agreement (which we havent seen yet). Grid said up to 18 months from signing. We will add footnote that it will be not later than 18 months from signing.
- Non-Loan Party restricted subsidiary debt basket – greater of $450M and 30% of EBITDA (flex to $375M and 25%). Grid response had asked for $350M and 25%, with flex to $225M and %

Take into account precedents and market practices:
- If the bank has agreed to the precedent, dont raise points that are consistent with the agreed precedent
- **Exception:** If something about the current transaction (e.g., capital structure or the target business) makes a change from the precedent appropriate to be considered
- Do raise points that are inconsistent with the agreed precedent
- If the bank has not agreed to the precedent proposed by the sponsor, highlight issues in the precedent
- Share a summary of the precedent from our Knowledge Management team (subject to confidentiality concerns mentioned below)

**Examples:**
- Conditions Precedent – Only stock of Borrower required to be delivered at closing (vs. Borrower and subs) [Magic, Connect – stock of wholly owned subs also to be delivered at close to the extent received from the Target]
- Hedges / cash mgmt can be secured if provided by a non-Lender and designated by the Borrower [same as Magic and Connect, not common as typically limited to agent/lenders or their affiliates]
- No requirement for lender calls (and no flex to require) but does include quarterly MD&A [same as Sponsor precedents except for Magic which had flex to add quarterly lender calls]

**Issues in the precedent:**
1. Limited Condition Transaction: Ability to borrow under revolver using LCT provision (i.e., no default condition/reps being brought down is measured when LCT transaction agreement is entered into)
2. Equity cure: up to 3 times in any 4 quarter period (typically 2 times), this is specific for sponsor

Take into account precedents and market practices:
- Where it would be helpful, describe how the issue was handled in other relevant transactions (e.g., other transactions of the sponsor, the targets existing credit agreement, other precedents in the industry of the target, other recent similar transactions by the bank)
- **Confidentiality:** Do not share any information about a confidential transaction unless the bank is party to the transaction or otherwise has received the documents (we may need to obtain consent from the sponsors counsel to share the proposed precedent)

Do not presume the clients response:

**Example:**
- Equity contribution (23%) (we will revert to 25% consistent with grid responses)
  a. To be made by Sponsor and certain unnamed co-investors [same as Sponsor precedents]
  b. Unlimited rollover equity permitted [same as Sponsor precedents]
- No cap on basket to incur subordinated term debt with the sponsor, which may be secured on a junior basis (consistent with existing CA)
- Note that newly formed or acquired entities are treated as loan parties under the covenants if the Borrower designates that they intend to make them a Loan Party until the deadline for which they are required to join (this does not appear to be in precedent or the existing credit agreement)

**How do you make an issues list easy to follow?**

Divide the issues list in sections:
- Commitment Letter
- Transaction Description
- Conditions: This section should cover both the Conditions Annex and the conditions section in the body of the commitment letter; could also be combined with Transaction Description issues
- Term Sheet: If there is flex in the fee letter for any issues identified in the term sheet, describe the flex where the issue is identified (not in the fee letter section of the issues list)
- Fee Letter (consider making this first in order because fees are high on our clients considerations)

**Example - Project Highlander Issues List OMM drafts of 4/19/21**

**Commitment Letter**
1. Facility Sizes: $28million term loans (reduced from $285 million in prior draft)
2. Return date April [ ] (we will add back five BDs)

**Term Sheet**
1. The dollar component of fixed baskets is still in open brackets

**Conditions Annex**
1. Quarterly financials are still open (we had specified that Sept, Dec. and March quarterlies would be required)
2. They agreed to the 60-day inside date

Have topic heading per issue (e.g., Commitment expiration date):
- Number the list so that issues can be readily referenced in calls or subsequent emails
- Use auto-numbering (if you dont know how to do this, have Steno do it)
- Separate out Legal issues from Business issues
- Either put legal issues in a separate list altogether, or at least flag them as LEGAL
- Some legal issues may just be addressed in the markup instead of on an issues list, but raise as business issue if not accepted; certain legal points are very important to our clients and we should not just trade markups on them
- Proofread for typos and grammatical mistakes

**Project Norman Commitment Papers Key Business Issues List**
Based on drafts dated 10/28/2021. Excludes terms set forth in grid response dated 10/23/2021.

**Commitment Letter**
1. **Titles and roles** - we will fill in BofA as lead left: global coordinator and leader arranger, and administrative agent and collateral agent for each facility.
2. **Additional Agents:**
   a. 15 business day period to appoint Additional Agents. Consistent with Amber.
   b. No limit on number of Additional Agents. Consistent with Amber.
   c. Commitment Parties on the signing date will retain not less than [%] of the commitments and economics.
3. **Syndication:** Lenders to be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower (acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld) and allocation of commitments among them subject to Borrower consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Consistent with Amber.

**DQ lenders include:**
i. known or reasonably identifiable (on the basis of name) affiliates of lenders on the DQ list. Consistent with Amber.
ii. competitors identified from time to time. Consistent with Amber.

**Syndication Period** - earlier of Successful Syndication and 60 calendar days after the Closing Date. Consistent with Amber.

**Ratings:** corporate ratings on Norman and facility ratings on Norman and Indigo; corporate rating on Indigo not required to be sought

**Clear market:**
i. includes exception for any indebtedness issued in lieu of the Facilities or the Interim Facilities, which makes the clear market meaningless
ii. also exception for separately committed bridge (or notes issued in lieu thereof); current engagement letter does not cover notes issued in lieu thereof

**Diligence information** - borrower not required to provide information to the extent that doing so would violate attorney-client privilege or confidentiality obligations. Includes requirements to give notice that information is being withheld and use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the information in a way that would not violate the privilege or obligation. All consistent with Amber.

**Information memorandum** to exculpate borrower for use of information. Consistent with Amber.

4. **Information** - supplements cure breach of information representation. Consistent with Amber Expenses - reimbursement only if the closing occurs. Amber allowed reimbursement of expenses incurred up to the primary syndication of the facilities even if the closing

## BODY OF THE COMMITMENT LETTER

### 2) Addressee

### 3) Commitments

> In connection with the foregoing, (a) [ ] is pleased to advise you of its several, but not joint, commitment to provide [ ]% of the principal amount of each of the Facilities, (b) [ ] is pleased to advise you of its several, but not joint, commitment to provide [ ]% of the principal amount of each of the Facilities, ...

Is it foreign or domestic? Foreign borrowers can raise tax/syndication issues

If it is an already existing borrower as opposed to a shell company for a new LBO, this will require analysis throughout the letter in assignments, expense reimbursement, **MFN,** prepayment premiums and conditions

**Commitment Percentage**
- Set forth the percentage of the financing facilities your client is being asked to commit to (entire/100%, [ ]%, some other percentage)

**Issues List**
Structured as multi-handed. Confirm what commitment percentage we should show for Bank. Also, does Bank expect to agent all facilities? Confirm funding entity for Bank.

- Commitments are usually the same percentage for each tranche of the financing
- If it does not say commitments are on a several and not joint basis, we should add in our markup

### 4) Titles/Roles

You will fill in your banks name in the markup, typically as the lead-left bank

Make sure another banks name is not filled in unless your client has approved that

If it is an incremental and you are representing the existing administrative agent, note if that name is not indicated

Certain banks that are traditionally right may not fill in their names as lead left; however, it is very important to notify your bank (especially in the last stages before signing) if your bank is not listed as a co-arranger/bookrunner

> It is agreed that (a) each of [ ] and [ ] will act as a joint bookrunner and a joint lead arranger (together with any additional lead arrangers appointed by the Borrower, each, in such capacity, a Lead Arranger and, collectively, the Lead Arrangers) for the Facilities, (b) [ ] will act as sole administrative agent and collateral agent for the Senior Facilities and (c) [ ] will act as sole administrative agent for the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth or referred to in this Commitment Letter. You may appoint additional co-agents, co-managers and one or more joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers reasonably acceptable to the Banks (the AdditionalArrangers and, together with the Banks, each, an Arranger and collectively, the Arrangers and, together with the Initial Lenders and their respective affiliates, the Financial Institutions, we or us). We, in such capacities, will perform the duties and exercise the authority customarily performed and exercised by us in such roles. You agree that (a) [ ] will have left placement in any and all marketing materials or other documentation used in connection with the Senior Facilities and the role and responsibilities customarily associated with such placement and (b) [ ] will have left placement in any and all marketing materials or other documentation used in connection with the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility and the role and responsibilities customarily associated with such placement. You and we further agree that no other titles will be awarded (other than that expressly contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter referred to below) in connection with the Facilities unless you and we shall so agree.

### 5) Economics Giveaway

Typically borrower has the ability to bring in other commitment parties after initial signing of the commitment letter:
- Allows the borrower to negotiate with fewer banks before the acquisition agreement is announced
- Gives borrower unilateral right to reduce the initial banks commitments (and corresponding economics)

**Points to look out for:**
- Number of days (business or calendar) after initial signing during which the borrower has the right to appoint additional commitment parties
- Banks favor shorter period since their balance sheets are being used from initial signing, and disfavor longer than business days
- Maximum percentage of the facility that may be allocated to additional commitment parties

> You shall have the right, at any time until 15 business days after the date this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter referred to below are executed and delivered by you, to obtain commitments from additional banks, financial institutions and other entities (the Bank Additional Initial Lenders and, together with the Banks, each, a Bank Initial Lender and, collectively, the Bank Initial Lenders) to assume the rights and obligations of the Banks hereunder in respect of up to 35% of the commitments under the Facilities (allocated ratably among the Facilities); provided that (x) the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Facilities that may be assumed by the Bank Additional Initial Lenders shall be reduced by any commitments under the Term Facility and/or the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility assumed by Additional Initial Non-Arranger Lenders and (y) the Bank Additional Initial Lenders and the assignment and assumption documentation shall be reasonably acceptable to the Banks. Each Banks commitments (and any commitment held by any and all lenders to which any Bank assigns a portion of its commitments in accordance with the terms hereof prior to the execution of such documentation other than to Bank Additional Initial Lenders or Additional Initial Non-Arranger Lenders) shall be reduced pro rata by the aggregate amount of commitments held by the Bank Additional Initial Lenders upon the execution by such Bank Additional Initial Lenders of such documentation and each such Bank Additional Initial Lenders several commitment shall be allocated pro rata among the Facilities.

**Issues List**

**Additional Arrangers**
a. 15 BDs to give away up to 35% of the commitments [% in Magic and Connect, BDs in Magic and Connect]

b. No prohibition on additional banks getting greater econs than you (same thing for non-arrangers below) [not included in either Magic or Connect, but consider in light of the percentage that they are seeking to allocate away]

Confirm that additional commitment parties are required to commit to the facilities on a ratable basis:
- The original banks want additional commitment parties to commit to each tranche ratably, and not just to the more liquid/marketable/attractive tranche
- Sometimes non-bank commitment parties do not commit to the revolver, but this is a business point

Ensure initial commitment parties commitments are reduced by those of the additional commitment parties on a ratable basis

If there are separate provisions for additional commitment parties that are not arrangers, make sure their commitments count toward the give-away basket

### 6) Syndication Provisions

#### (1) Disqualified (DQ) Lenders

Ability to name non-competitors after date hereof (when bank signs, not when borrower signs) is problematic since commitment parties will not know the universe of DQ lenders when they sign

Sometimes agent/lead left alone can consent to additions as opposed to all commitment parties

Competitors are not subject to similar type of borrower discretion so post-signing identification is customary, although sometimes suspended between launch of syndication and closing

> Each Lender further agrees not to syndicate any of the commitments with respect to the Facilities to certain financial institutions and other entities that have been specified by you in writing on or prior to the date hereof or competitors of the Target and its subsidiaries specified by you in writing on or prior to the date hereof (the list of which may be updated from time to time by you in writing (i) after the date hereof and prior to the syndication of the Facilities and/or (ii) following the earlier to occur of a Successful Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter) and 60 days after the Closing Date, in each case, with respect to additional bona fide competitors of the Target and its subsidiaries and any affiliates of such bona fide competitors identified in writing (excluding any affiliate that is a bona fide debt fund)) (collectively, the Disqualified Lenders); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such additional designation shall not apply retroactively to any prior assignment or participation made to any Lender that was permitted hereunder at the time of such assignment or participation.

**DISQUALIFIED (DQ) LENDERS**

flag if DQ lenders are not required to be identified specifically in writing (or reasonably identifiable, as all subsidiaries and affiliates of a DQ lender may not be obvious on their face)

Many of the big **PE** funds have debt arms:
- Ability to designate competitors and affiliates as DQ lenders should have exclusion for bona fide debt funds that are affiliates

Check that any designation for any reason (competitors or otherwise) does not apply retroactively, so that lenders are not blindsided by additions they didnt know when they entered the credit

**Issues List**

DQ lenders – omits bona fide debt fund exception [inconsistent with Magic and Connect]

#### (2) Syndication Assistance Period

Usually ends at earlier of Successful Syndication (when loan either allocates or funds) and 30, 45 or 60 days post-closing.

In case credit facility closes before commitment parties have syndicated their exposures, need this period to extend beyond closing.

Note that credit agreement will not contain any syndication assistance provisions, so this provision should survive the closing date.

> We intend to commence syndication efforts promptly upon the execution of this Commitment Letter, and you agree to actively assist us in completing a syndication that is reasonably satisfactory to us and you until the earlier to occur of a Successful Syndication and 60 days after the Closing Date.

**Issues List**

Syndication assistance post-closing sunset: 60 days post-closing [consistent with Michaels and Connect]

#### (3) Elements of Syndication Assistance

**Public corporate** rating of borrower and term loan facility from each of Moodys and S&P. Watch out for two of Moodys, S&P and Fitch or any other formulation that doesnt require both Moodys and S&P.

Some form of bank meeting, even if virtual—need to see faces of senior representatives of the borrower and hear their voices

Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) or Lender Presentation (LP)

**Issues List**

Up to 3 lender meetings or conference calls [consistent with all Sponsor precedent]

**CIM** – to be in form and substance substantially consistent with the CIM for recent transactions by the Sponsor [not in Magic, but consistent with other Sponsor precedent]

> During such period, such assistance shall include ... (c) assistance by you and the Sponsor (and, subject always to the extent expressly provided in the Purchase Agreement, your using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the assistance by the Target and its subsidiaries) in the preparation of a confidential information memorandum (Confidential Information Memorandum) in form and substance substantially consistent with the confidential information memoranda in recent transactions sponsored by the Sponsor for each of the Facilities and other customary marketing materials to be used in connection with the syndication of the Facilities, (d) your using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (which use of commercially reasonable efforts shall not require you to change the proposed terms of the Facilities), upon our request, prior to the commencement of general syndication of the Facilities, (i) public ratings for the Senior Facilities, the Senior Unsecured Notes and, if requested by the Lead Arrangers, the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility and (ii) a public corporate credit rating and public corporate family rating in respect of the Borrower, in each case, from each of S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), respectively, and (e) the hosting, with the Arrangers, of up to three meetings, including virtual meetings, or conference calls of prospective Lenders at times and locations mutually agreed upon.

#### (4) Public vs Private

Borrower should make representation that the CIM/LP does not contain MNPI

Our clients also want a representation that the information representation is true:
- Some sponsors resist this, and this may be acceptable if target agrees in acquisition agreement to provide such representation

Public side information should include all loan documents, term sheets, and syndication information

> You agree, at the request of the Lead Arrangers, to assist us in the preparation of a version of the Confidential Information Memorandum and other customary marketing materials to be used in connection with the syndication of the Facilities, consisting exclusively of information that is either (i) publicly available (or, in the case of a company that is not a public reporting company, information of a type that would reasonably be expected to be publicly available if such company were a public reporting company) or (ii) not material with respect to Holdings (as defined in the Transaction Description), the Borrower, the Target and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any of their respective securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (all such information and documentation being Public Lender Information). Any information and documentation that is not Public Lender Information is referred to herein as Private Lender Information. It is understood that, in connection with your assistance described above, customary authorization letters, consistent with the terms of this Commitment Letter, will be included in any information package and presentation whereby you authorize the distribution of such information to prospective Lenders containing a representation substantially consistent with the first sentence of Section 4 of this Commitment Letter and a representation by you to the Financial Institutions that the Public Lender Information does not include material non-public information (or, in the case of a company that is not a public reporting company, material information of a type that would not reasonably be expected to be publicly available if such company were a public reporting company) about Holdings, the Borrower, the Target and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or their respective securities and exculpating us with respect to any liability related to the use of the contents of such Public Lender Information or any other related marketing materials by the recipients thereof.

#### (5) Exceptions to Obligation to Provide Information

Borrower will not want to provide information to the lenders if there is a binding confidentiality agreement or if it would adversely affect the privileged nature of such document

Banks seek language that borrower will notify them if the borrower withholds information and uses efforts to overcome restriction and not enter into such arrangements in order to qualify for this carve-out

> For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the foregoing requirements to provide assistance, you will not be required to provide any information to the extent that the provision thereof would violate any law, rule or regulation, or any obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party and binding on you, the Target or your or its respective affiliates, or waive any attorney client privilege of you, the Sponsor, the Target or your or their respective affiliates; provided that no such obligations of confidentiality shall be entered into in contemplation of this sentence and in the event you do not provide information in reliance on this sentence, if permitted you shall provide notice to us that such information is being withheld and you shall use your commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the relevant consents and to communicate, to the extent both feasible and permitted under applicable law, rule, regulation or confidentiality obligation and, to the extent such communication would not risk waiver of privilege, the applicable information.

#### (6) Clear Market

Agreement by the borrower not to market or incur competing debt (if borrower is a carve-out or subsidiary, consider if parent or affiliate should be covered)

Length of time should generally be the same as the post-closing syndication assistance

Scope of clear market include both credit facilities and debt securities

Sometimes clients are OK with limiting credit facilities to those that are syndicated:
- However, clients should be aware that the limitation to syndicated credit facilities would exclude bilateral facilities, club deals, privately placed deals, etc.

Concept is also included in purchase agreements/ underwriting agreements

> You hereby agree that, prior to the earlier of a Successful Syndication and 60 days after the Closing Date, there shall be no competing issues, offerings or placements of debt securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities by or on behalf of you or the Borrower, and you will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that there are no competing issues, offerings or placements of debt securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities by or on behalf of the Target or its subsidiaries, being offered, placed or arranged (other than the Facilities, the Senior Unsecured Notes (and/or the Securities), any indebtedness of the Target and its subsidiaries permitted to be incurred or outstanding pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and other indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business of the Target and its subsidiaries for capital expenditures and working capital purposes), without the consent of the Lead Arrangers, if such issuance, offering, placement or arrangement would reasonably be expected to materially impair the primary syndication of the Facilities or the offering of the Senior Unsecured Notes (and/or the Securities).

**Issues List**

Clear market exceptions include ordinary course debt for cap ex and working capital [consistent with other Sponsor precedent]

### 7) Information Representation

Exclusions should only be projections and general economic/industry info—not matters unique to borrower

If commitment is for an incremental facility, make sure that knowledge qualifier does not apply to the borrower or any other person that that entity signing the letter already owns or is under common control with Information.

> You hereby represent that (with respect to information relating to the Target and its subsidiaries, to the best of your knowledge) (a) all written factual information (other than the Projections, forward looking information and information of a general economic or industry specific nature) (the Information) that has been or will be made available to us by you, the Target, the Sponsor or any of your or their representatives on your behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, when taken as a whole, is or will be, when furnished, correct in all material respects and does not or will not, when furnished, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements are made (giving effect to all supplements and updates provided thereto) and (b) the Projections and other forward looking information that have been or will be made available to us by you, the Target, the Sponsor or any of your or their respective representatives on your behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby have been or will be prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that you believe to be reasonable at the time made and at the time such Projections are made available to us; it being understood by the Lenders that such Projections are as to future events and are not to be viewed as facts, such Projections are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such Projections may differ significantly from the projected results, such differences may be material, and that no assurance can be given that the projected results will be realized. You agree that, if at any time prior to the earlier of the occurrence of a Successful Syndication and the date that is 60 days after the Closing Date, you become aware that any of the representations in the preceding sentence would be incorrect (to the best of your knowledge with respect to Information and Projections and any forward looking information relating to the Target and its subsidiaries) in any material respect if the Information and Projections were being furnished, and such representations were being made, at such time, then you will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly supplement the Information and the Projections so that such representations will be correct (to the best of your knowledge with respect to Information and Projections and any forward looking information relating to the Target and its subsidiaries) in all material respects under those circumstances; provided that the obligations to supplement the Information and Projections under this sentence shall not in any event terminate prior to the Closing Date.

### 8) Indemnity

Make sure indemnity covers claims brought by borrower itself or target in addition to third parties (Hooper/Flexiti corrective language). If this language is not included, courts may not enforce borrowers liability for paying the banks legal fees if borrower itself is suing the banks

Make sure to include coverage for conflicts counsel if the coverage for counsel is limited to single counsel

**Example:** 
> Indemnification; Expenses. You agree (a) to indemnify and hold harmless each Financial Institution and its affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons, members, advisors and representatives of each of the foregoing and their respective successors and assigns (each, an Indemnified Person) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which any such Indemnified Person may become subject arising out of or in connection with this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Transactions, the Facilities, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Facilities or any related transaction or any actual or threatened claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding (any such claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding, a Proceeding) relating to any of the foregoing, regardless of whether any such Indemnified Person is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by you, your or the Targets equity holders, creditors or any other third party or by Holdings, the Borrower, the Target or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates), and to reimburse each such Indemnified Person promptly upon demand for any reasonable documented out-of-pocket legal expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the foregoing by one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Persons, taken as a whole (and, if necessary, by a single firm of local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all Indemnified Persons, taken as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Indemnified Person affected by such conflict informs you of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel with your prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), of another firm of counsel (and local counsel, if applicable) for such affected Indemnified Person)) and other reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the foregoing or in connection with the enforcement of any provision of this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter ...

**Three carve-outs to the indemnity:**
- **Material** breach by commitment parties (sometimes in suit brought by borrower, any breach; however, this is controversial and should be flagged)
- Willful misconduct, **gross** negligence, also often bad faith
- Indemnified parties suing each other, except if targeted in role as agent/arranger

First two must be finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; cannot just be allegation

Carve-outs apply on indemnified party by indemnified party basis; bad acts from one indemnified party cannot invalidate indemnity for other indemnified parties, except if they are related

> provided that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any Indemnified Person, apply to (A) losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (i) to the extent they are found in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person or any of such Indemnified Persons controlled or controlling affiliates or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons, members, advisors or representatives (collectively, such Indemnified Persons Related Persons) (provided that each reference to representatives pertains solely to such representatives involved in the negotiation of this Commitment Letter or syndication of the Facilities), (ii) arising out of a material breach by such Indemnified Person (or any of such Indemnified Persons Related Persons) of its obligations under this Commitment Letter (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment) or (iii) arising out of any claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not involve an act or omission of you or any of your affiliates and that is brought by an Indemnified Person against any other Indemnified Person (other than any claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding against any Financial Institution in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as an administrative agent, or other agent or Arranger under the Facilities), ...

Acceptable to carve out special/punitive/ consequential damages, but only if it applies to all parties and only if indemnity still covers those damages alleged by a third party claim

Banks should have no liability to borrower or its affiliates other than under the commitment letter

Commitment letter should expressly exclude liability for commitment parties for use by others of info obtained through electronic platforms, except for liability finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to result from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the commitment parties:
- Important for our clients since they post copious information regarding the borrower to platforms such as SyndTrak

Borrower will want the ability to settle litigation affecting indemnified parties, but any settlement must:
- include unconditional release of the indemnified parties and
- cannot include admission of fault by the indemnified parties

Commitment parties should not have lingering liability or reputational damage

> You shall not, without the prior written consent of each applicable Indemnified Person (which consent, except with respect to a settlement including a statement of the type referred to in clause (b) below, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceedings in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person unless such settlement (a) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceedings, (b) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person and (c) includes customary confidentiality and non-disparagement agreements.

### 9) Expense Reimbursement

If the commitment is to a shell company, the banks are reimbursed for expenses only if the closing date occurs:
- Confirm that reimbursement for counsel fees covers all trees at , not just counsel for the lead left bank or the administrative agent
- Include coverage for regulatory or other special counsel if your deal will involve such counsel
- If the commitment letter is for an incremental, there is an already existing borrower that should be able to pay expenses for an unconsummated deal, whereas in a new LBO there will not be
- Commitment letters of ABL facilities should require field exam work to be paid regardless of whether the deal closes or not

> It is further agreed that the Financial Institutions shall have no liability to any person other than you, and you shall have no liability to any person other than the Financial Institutions and the Indemnified Persons in connection with this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Facilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through internet, electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems except to the extent they are found in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person or any of its Related Persons. of the Indemnified Persons or (except solely as a result of your indemnification obligations set forth above to the extent an Indemnified Person is found so liable) you, the Sponsor or any of your or its respective affiliates or the respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, and agents of the foregoing shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages in connection with this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Facilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

> ...(b) in the event the Closing Date occurs, to reimburse the Financial Institutions from time to time, upon presentation of a reasonably detailed summary statement, for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses (including but not limited to expenses of our due diligence investigation, fees of consultants hired with your prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), syndication expenses, travel expenses and fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel identified in the Term Sheets and of a single firm of local counsel to the Arrangers in each appropriate jurisdiction retained with your prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Indemnified Person affected by such conflict informs you of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel with your prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), of another firm of counsel (and local counsel, if applicable) for such affected Indemnified Person)), in each case, incurred in connection with the Facilities and the preparation, negotiation and enforcement of this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the definitive documentation for the Facilities and any ancillary documents or security arrangements in connection therewith

### 10) Conflicts Etc.

There should be several paragraphs related to the banks engaging in other transactions or potential transactions and not having any fiduciary duties to the borrower

If a commitment party (or an affiliate of a commitment party) is a financial advisor on the M&A transaction (whether to the buyer or the target/seller), typically the bank will want to include specific waiver language indicating that the two roles are distinct and could have differing objectives (e.g., higher acquisition price may result in higher leverage)

> Sharing Information; Absence of Fiduciary Relationship; Affiliate Activities. You acknowledge that we may be providing debt financing, equity capital or other services (including financial advisory services) to other companies in respect of which you may have conflicting interests regarding the transactions described herein or otherwise. ...

> In addition, please note that X has been retained as a sell-side financial advisor (in such capacity, the Financial Advisor) in connection with the Acquisition. Each party hereto agrees to such retention, and further agrees not to assert any claim it might allege based on any actual or potential conflicts of interest that might be asserted to arise or result primarily from the engagement of the Financial Advisor and/or its affiliates, on the one hand, including with respect to arranging or providing financing for a competing bidder, and, on the other hand, our and our affiliates relationships with you described and referred to herein. You acknowledge that, in such capacity, the FinancialAdvisor and/or its affiliates may advise the Sellers in other manners adverse to the interests of the parties hereto. Each of the Financial Institutions party hereto acknowledges (i) the retention of X as a FinancialAdvisor and (ii) that such relationship does not create any fiduciary duties or fiduciary responsibilities to such Financial Institution on the part of X or its affiliates.

**Issues List**

Confirm if Bank has any financial advisory role in the M&A transaction

### 11) Assignments

Assignments should be permitted only to domestic affiliates and should ideally be a shell company

If the commitment is for a non-shell borrower (e.g., a strategic buyer or an incremental facility), then no assignment should be allowed by borrower since the banks commitment is to provide financing to the borrower, which will own the target

In no event should the commitment letter be permitted to be assigned to an existing portfolio company of the sponsor, the target or the seller. If there is a request for the commitment letter to be addressed to or assigned to the target or the seller, this should be flagged immediately.

The commitment parties will be required to be on the hook for the financing until the initial funding has occurred, despite any syndication

> Assignments. This Commitment Letter shall not be assignable by any party hereto (other than by you to the Borrower or one of your domestic affiliates formed for the purpose of consummating the Transactions (other than any portfolio company of the Sponsor), in any case that will, after giving effect to the Transactions, (i) own (directly or indirectly) the Target or be a successor to the Target and (ii) be controlled by the Sponsor), without the prior written consent of each other party hereto (not to be unreasonably withheld) and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and void, is intended to be solely for the benefit of the parties hereto (and Indemnified Persons to the extent expressly provided for herein), and is not intended to confer any benefits upon, or create any rights in favor of, any person other than the parties hereto (and Indemnified Persons to the extent expressly provided for herein); provided that each Bank Initial Lender may assign its commitments hereunder (subject to the provisions set forth in this Commitment Letter) to one or more prospective Lenders, provided, further, that, except for assignments to Bank Additional Initial Lenders as set forth above, such Initial Lender shall only be released from the portion of its commitments hereunder so assigned to the extent such assignee funds (or, in the case of the Revolving Facility, provides) the portion of the commitments assigned to it on the Closing Date on the terms and conditions to such funding set forth herein.

### 12) Amendments

Confirm all commitment parties are needed to amend or waive any provision of the commitment papers

Some drafts will permit amendments or waivers with majority vote of the commitment parties, which can affect pricing, commitment period, etc.:
- This will be crucial to your clients and should be flagged even if in the precedent

> This Commitment Letter may not be amended or any provision hereof waived or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by us and you.

Remember that the commitment letter contains terms that would be all-affected lender votes in the credit agreement, such as commitment length and in the term sheet items like pricing, maturity etc. No lender would agree to be dragged on these types of points in a credit agreement so should not be done in a commitment letter either.

Sometimes the waiver language is in the relevant provision (such as in the conditions section)

### 13) Governing Law

Commitment papers and all disputes arising thereunder must be governed by New York law

However certain provisions that are tied to the acquisition agreement are typically governed by the law governing the acquisition agreement so you need to check what that is by reviewing the acquisition agreement

If the law governing the acquisition agreement is not Delaware, must be flagged (especially if non-US)

### 14) Jurisdiction

Parties must submit to exclusive jurisdiction of Federal and State courts located in Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof) for all disputes arising under the commitment papers

Deviations from standard language should be checked carefully

> **Jurisdiction.** Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and determined only in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court, (b) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any such New York State or Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court, and (d) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. You and we agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to you or us at the respective addresses set forth above shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court.

### 15) Waiver of Jury Trial

Must be included

Not controversial, unless missing!

Waiver of jury trial provision should be included in most financing agreements we work on

### 16) Confidentiality

Protects both the borrower and the banks; unlike the credit agreement, where only the borrower is protected since it is the only one disseminating information

Usually long list of exceptions on both sides:
- Confirm that all the customary exceptions for the banks are included

> **Confidentiality.** This Commitment Letter is delivered to you on the understanding that of the Fee Letter and its terms or substance or, prior to your acceptance hereof, this Commitment Letter and its terms or substance, shall be disclosed, directly or indirectly, by you to any other person except ....

> We shall use all non-public information received by or on behalf of us and our affiliates in connection with this Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby solely for the purposes of negotiating, evaluating and consulting on the transactions contemplated hereby and providing the services that are the subject of this Commitment Letter and shall treat confidentially, together with the terms and substance of this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, all such information; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent us from disclosing any such information... (d) upon the request or demand of any regulatory or self-regulatory authority having or asserting jurisdiction over us or our respective affiliates (in which case, except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental, regulatory, or self-regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority, we shall promptly notify you, in advance, to the extent reasonably practical and permitted by law)....

**Issues List**

Confidentiality [Legal] – no language allowing disclosure to market data collectors [consistent with other Sponsor precedent]

If the commitment letter is for an incremental facility, the confidentiality provision in the credit agreement may be incorporated by reference for the benefit of the borrower:
- However, you still need to have confidentiality provisions that are for the benefit of the banks (confidentiality of the commitment papers, which contain pricing, etc.)

> Each of the Commitment Parties, each Incremental Lead Arranger and each Initial Incremental Term Lender shall use all information received by them in connection with the Transactions and the related transactions (including any information obtained by them based on a review of any books and records relating to Holdings, the Borrower or the Target or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) solely for the purposes of providing the commitments that are the subject of this Commitment Letter and shall treat confidentially, in accordance with Section .25 of the First Lien Credit Agreement as if (a) such Commitment Party were a Lender thereunder, (b) all such information and the terms and contents thereof was Information thereunder and (c) this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter and the Incremental Facility Documentation were Loan Documents thereunder, and such provisions are incorporated herein mutatis mutandis. The provisions of this paragraph shall automatically terminate on the date that is two years following the Acceptance Date, unless (and only to the extent) earlier superseded by the Incremental Facilities Documentation.

### 17) Surviving Provisions

Indemnity/expenses, fiduciary duty, confidentiality, governing law, jurisdiction and waiver of jury trial should survive closing or termination of the commitment letter

Syndication assistance provisions and information representation should survive closing for the negotiated post-closing assistance period

If this provision uses cross references to numbered sections, check those cross references carefully

Most of these items can be superseded by applicable provisions in the credit agreement if the closing occurs, except for provisions that will not be in the credit agreement such as syndication or confidentiality in favor of the banks, and fee letter provisions (such as flex and administrative agent fees)

> **Surviving Provisions.** The survival, compensation, reimbursement, indemnification, absence of fiduciary relationship, confidentiality, information, syndication, jurisdiction, governing law and waiver of jury trial provisions contained herein and in the Fee Letter and the provisions of Section 8 of this Commitment Letter shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms notwithstanding the termination of this Commitment Letter or the Initial Lenders commitments hereunder and our agreements to perform the services described herein; ...

> **Surviving Provisions.** . . .provided, that your obligations under this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, other than those provisions relating to confidentiality, compensation and to the syndication of the Facilities, shall automatically terminate and be superseded by the definitive documentation relating to the Facilities upon the initial funding thereunder, and you shall automatically be released from all liability in connection therewith at such time. You may terminate this Commitment Letter and/or the Initial Lenders commitments with respect to the Facilities hereunder at any time subject to the preceding sentence.

### 18) Sign-by Date

The bank obligates itself at the time of the bid, while the borrower/sponsor has typically a period of one to three weeks

Borrower typically countersigns only when it signs an acquisition agreement:
- It is atypical for a borrower not to countersign the letters at such time, as it has to make representations in the acquisition agreement about having fully signed and enforceable commitment letters

If the date is blank, make sure there is a footnote that the sign-by date is no longer than [ ] days

If possible, add that the sign-by date is no later than public announcement of the transaction

Many lenders dont want to have a long period for borrower to sign since they are locked in on terms:
- On one hand, it is just a few extra weeks for an already long commitment period; on the other hand, banks dont want to be obligated for a deal that doesnt exist

Remember that nothing in the commitment letter is binding on the borrower (including the confidentiality provision) unless and until borrower countersigns, so borrower can shop around the financing terms

Confirm that appropriate electronic signature language is included

**Issues List**

Countersign date: [ ], 2024

> **Signing Acceptance.** If the foregoing correctly sets forth our agreement with you, please indicate your acceptance of the terms of this Commitment Letter and of the Fee Letter by returning to us executed counterparts hereof and of the Fee Letter not later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on [ ]. The Initial Lenders commitments hereunder, and our agreements to perform the services described herein, will expire automatically and without further action or notice and without further obligation to you at such time in the event that we have not received such executed counterparts in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

## 1) Commitment Period

Commitment period is usually defined by reference to a Termination Date (or Drop Dead Date) in the acquisition agreement as in effect on the date hereof:
- In such case, ensure that it is defined by reference to the acquisition agreement as in effect (or the draft provided to your client) on the date your client signs
- If there is an **extension feature** included within the definition of Termination Date in the acquisition agreement, flag it to your client
- If the acquisition agreement does not yet have a clear Termination Date, make sure there is a footnote stating maximum commitment period your client is willing to agree to

Commitment should terminate when the borrowers obligations under the acquisition agreement terminates or if acquisition closes without the financing being used

> **Termination.** In the event that (i) the Closing Date does not occur on or before the date that is five business days after the Termination Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date hereof and as it may be extended in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date hereof), (ii) the Purchase Agreement is terminated without the consummation of the Acquisition (as defined in the Transaction Description) having occurred or (iii) the closing of the Acquisition occurs (x) in the case of the Senior Facilities, without the use of the Senior Facilities or (y) in the case of the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, without the use of the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, then this Commitment Letter and the Initial Lenders commitments hereunder, and our agreements to perform the services described herein, shall automatically terminate with respect to the applicable Facility without further action or notice and without further obligation to you unless we shall, in our discretion, agree to an extension.

**Issues List**

Outside date – discuss if any indicative commitment period length has been discussed or if we should footnote customary 18 month expectation Outside date - 5 BD cushion to acquisition outside date with no footnote showing expected commitment length. We noted in the grid that you had indicated that you had assumed a day outside date.

## 2) Transaction Description / Conditions Precedent

### 1) Description of Transaction

The transaction may be described in the body of the commitment letter or in an annex thereto

The transaction description should be consistent with the business understanding of the deal and also with the M&A documentation:
- If the M&A documentation is not yet available, your review of this section should be subject to review of the M&A documentation

**Example 1:**

> Buyer intends to enter into the Purchase Agreement with Sellers and the Target, pursuant to which the Buyer will directly or indirectly acquire the Target (the Acquisition). Holdings will be controlled by investment funds, or affiliates of investment funds, advised, managed or controlled by [ ] or its affiliates (collectively, the Sponsor) and, at the Sponsors election, certain co-investors arranged or designated by the Sponsor (collectively with the Sponsor, the Investors). The term Borrower means the Buyer. The term Holdings means the direct parent of the Borrower.

**Example 2:**

> The Company, intends to acquire, directly or indirectly, 100% of the issued share capital (the Target Shares) in an entity previously identified to us by you as Indigo (Indigo) pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date of the Commitment Letter, among the Company, the Investor Sellers (as defined therein) and the Management Sellers (as defined therein) (together with all schedules, exhibits and annexes thereto, the Acquisition Agreement). In connection with the foregoing, it is intended that...

**Important defined terms to understand include:**
- Borrower
- Holdings
- Sponsor
- Acquisition/Transaction
- Closing Date

### 2) CP: Consummation of Transaction

> The Acquisition Agreement shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Arrangers [(it being understood that the draft of the Acquisition Agreement received by counsel to the Lead Arrangers at [ ] on [ ] is reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Arrangers)]. The Acquisition shall have been consummated prior to, or shall be consummated substantially concurrently with, the initial borrowing under any of the Senior Secured Facilities.

Conditions precedent (CPs) are typically contained in a conditions annex but certain CP provisions are often included in the body of the commitment letter and sometimes in the term sheet

They should be read in conjunction with the transaction description

The **bid versions** of the commitment letter should include a CP that the acquisition documentation is reasonably satisfactory to the commitment parties:
- This CP will be removed once the sponsor counsel confirms that we have received the final acquisition documentation and are satisfied with it

The M&A transaction should be required to close substantially concurrently with the initial funding (or effectiveness) under the committed facilities, in accordance with the acquisition agreement

### 3) CP: No Amendment of Acquisition Agreement

Amendments or waivers to the acquisition agreement should not be materially adverse to the commitment parties without consent of the **commitment parties** (sometimes defined as the Initial Lenders):
- The acquisition agreement typically contains provisions for the target to cooperate in the financing; these provisions benefit the commitment parties, not the lenders
- Some sponsors may push for the ability of **majority of the commitment parties** to consent to amendments/waivers of the acquisition agreement; flag any such provision

Changes to the definition of Material Adverse Effect are usually deemed material and adverse to interests of the lenders

**Example:**
> The Acquisition Agreement shall not have been amended or waived, and no consent with respect thereto shall have been provided, in a manner materially adverse to the Initial Lenders (in their capacities as such) without the consent of the Lead Arrangers whose affiliates hold more than 50% of the aggregate commitments on the date hereof with respect to the Senior Secured Facilities (the Majority Lead Arrangers) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed); provided, that (i) any change to the definition of Material Adverse Effect contained in the Acquisition Agreement shall be deemed materially adverse to the Initial Lenders and shall require the consent of the Majority Lead Arrangers, ...

### 4) CP: No Amendment of Acquisition Agreement

#### (1) Purchase Price Changes

Changes in the acquisition agreement to reduce the purchase price raise concerns for commitment parties:
- May signal that there is, or may arguably be, a material adverse change at the target
- M&A parties may re-negotiate the purchase price to reflect the negative impact, instead of calling a MAC, which would give commitment parties right to terminate their commitments
- Also raises the question of there being of debt financing that is too large for a reduced purchase price

> provided, that ... (ii) any reduction in the aggregate purchase price shall be deemed not to be materially adverse to the Initial Lenders (it being understood that (1) such reduction of the aggregate purchase price shall be first applied to reduce the Equity Contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis until the amount of the Equity Contribution is equal to 50% of the total Closing Date pro forma capitalization of the Borrower (as determined pursuant to paragraph (b) on Exhibit A to the Commitment Letter), and (2) thereafter, any additional amount of such reduction shall be applied as follows: (x) 50% to reduce the Equity Contribution and (y) 50% to reduce the amount of funded debt on the Closing Date under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Facility (on a pro rata basis))

In middle-market deals, commitment parties may have right to consent for any reduction [greater than [10]%] of the purchase price

In other deals, commitment parties typically accept this risk and the flash point is how the reduction affects the capital structure:
- Reduce debt and equity contribution ratably
- Reduce equity to required minimum equity contribution and then reduce debt and equity contribution ratably

Note any threshold below which purchase price may be reduced before debt/equity reduction applies

**Issues List**

Purchase price reduction: Deemed not materially adverse and applied to reduce equity first until minimum equity contribution, and then ratably between the 1st lien and 2nd lien term loans (no minimum on either tranche) and the equity contribution

Your client may not want smaller components of the capital structure reduced beyond a minimum amount due to liquidity and syndication concerns and may want to redirect it to a larger tranche unless it is eliminated entirely by reduction

Sponsors/borrowers will often want to eliminate most expensive tranche first, so notify your client of any non-pro rata reductions in facilities

Increases in purchase price should be in additional equity contribution or at least not preferred equity:
- Revolver up to amount of permitted draw to fund transactions is generally fine, but note any other debt to fund increases

> provided, that ... (iii) any increase in the purchase price of, or consideration for, the Acquisition under the Acquisition Agreement shall not be deemed materially adverse to the Lenders so long as funded with equity of the same type referred to in clause a) (or other equity reasonably acceptable to the Majority Lead Arrangers (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) of the Transaction Description (it being understood and agreed that no purchase price, working capital or similar adjustment provisions set forth in the Acquisition Agreement shall constitute a reduction or increase in the purchase price)

#### (2) Equity Contribution

Sponsor forms an equity syndicate, often called the Investors, and usually includes rollover equity:
- Important to require that **sponsor controls a majority** of the voting (and sometimes economic) equity at closing

Should be in the form of **common equity** of holdings, which is then contributed to borrower common equity

Preferred equity can cause credit issues if mandatory redemptions or dividends prior to debt maturities and can have credit rating implications if treated as debt by rating agencies, so any form of equity other than common should be reasonably acceptable to the commitment parties

> In connection with the Acquisition, it is intended that the Investors will contribute, directly or indirectly, an amount (the Equity Contribution) to Holdings in the form of common equity, or other equity on terms reasonably acceptable to the Lead Arrangers, and which shall be further contributed to the Borrower in the form of common equity, which would cause the equity interests of Holdings (including roll-over or contributed equity), to represent not less than the Equity Contribution Percentage (as defined in the Fee Letter) of the total pro forma capitalization of Holdings ...; provided that the Sponsor shall directly or indirectly (whether by contract or otherwise) control not less than a majority of the voting and economic interests in Holdings on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions;...

At a high level, the equity contribution percentage is calculated as:

[new equity + rollover] / [entire debt + equity capitalization of the Borrower]

However negotiated nuances to this formula have been developed over the years

Acceptable to exclude debt that is not really part of the capitalization from the calculation, such as working capital or debt resulting from flexed OID, but note formulations such as excluding all drawings under revolver or ABL:
- If the borrower will be rolling over any debt but such rollover debt is not included in the calculation, that should be flagged to your client

Debt is sometimes calculated net of cash, but note to your client if this is the case and whether it is not specified as unrestricted cash

> ... the Equity Contribution Percentage (as defined in the Fee Letter) of the total **pro forma capitalization of Holdings** (to be defined as the sum of (x) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of funded debt for borrowed money (excluding for purposes of this determination increased levels of debt as a result of all OID and/or upfront fees in respect of the Facilities, the Securities (as defined in the Fee Letter) and/or the Senior Unsecured Notes in connection with the exercise of the Market Flex and/or Securities Demand provisions under the Fee Letter, any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Facility on the Closing Date to fund working capital requirements of the Borrower and its subsidiaries and any outstanding letters of credit (to the extent undrawn)) net of unrestricted balance sheet cash and (y) the total amount of equity (including rollover or contributed equity); ...

> The Equity Contribution shall have been made (or substantially simultaneously or substantially concurrently) with the closing under the Senior Facilities in at least the amount set forth in Exhibit A.

**Rollover equity** keeps management incentivized and reduces sponsors cash purchase price:
- can be in form of (i) preferred equity or (ii) other equity (only (ii) must be on terms reasonably acceptable to the Lead Arrangers (inconsistent with Ironman))
- Calculation of minimum equity excludes revolver proceeds used for working capital purposes, for purchase price adjustments or to fund Transaction Costs (consistent with Ironman)
- If the borrower is already an operating company (such as a strategic buyer or in the case of an incremental facility), no new equity may be contemplated, but confirm that with your client
- Should include condition that the Equity Contribution must be consummated concurrently with or prior to initial funding under the facilities

**Issues List**

Minimum equity contribution is 50% of the debt borrowed for transaction + equity contribution

## Preparing a Commitment Letter Issues List, Part III: Conditions Precedent

### 5) Refinancing Description and CP

Check with diligence team and/or check public filings or financial statements to understand existing debt at target

If any material debt is not required to be repaid, that may impact the collateral package of new debt or the capital structure; confirm with your client the business understanding:
- Typically capital leases and small working capital lines for non-US subsidiaries are permitted to remain outstanding

Refinancing should cover 3 components:
- repayment of outstanding obligations
- discharge of liens
- termination of outstanding commitments

**Transaction Description**

> ...indebtedness under (i) the Credit Agreement, dated [ ] (the **Existing Credit Agreement**), by and among [ ], (ii) the Indenture, dated [ ], by and among [ ] and (iii) the Indenture, dated [ ], among [ ], will be repaid, prepaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased or discharged (and any liens related thereto released) or arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Arrangers for such repayment, prepayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or discharge shall have been made (other than in respect of letters of credit that are either rolled into or back-stopped by letter(s) of credit issued under the Senior Facilities or cash collateralized by the Borrower or its subsidiaries or contingent obligations not then due and payable) and all commitments thereunder will be terminated (and related security interests will be terminated and released) on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the **Refinancing**);

**Conditions Annex**

**Example 1:** The Refinancing shall have been consummated or, substantially concurrently with the closing under the Term Facility shall be consummated.

**Issues List**

No requirement for all target debt to be refinanced [consistent with Connect]

**Example 2:** On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, Holdings and its subsidiaries shall not have any third party debt for borrowed money or preferred stock other than (i) the ABL Facility, (ii) Customer Financing Arrangements, (iii) any rollover of then existing capital leases and (iv) other indebtedness approved by the Lead Arranger in its reasonable discretion.

### The New Financing

Confirm debt quantums against grid or other business understanding, and note any discrepancies

> ... the Borrower will obtain (i) the senior secured first lien term loan facility described in the Senior Facilities Term Sheet in an aggregate principal amount of $[ ] (the Term Facility) and (ii) the senior secured first lien revolving credit facility described in the Senior Facilities Term Sheet in an aggregate principal amount of $[ ] (the `Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Facility, the Senior Facilities); the Borrower will, at its option, either (i) issue senior unsecured notes (the Senior Unsecured Notes) in a Rule 144A or other private placement yielding $[ ] in aggregate gross cash proceeds and/or (ii) if any or all of the Senior Unsecured Notes are not issued on or prior to the Closing Date and the proceeds thereof made available to the Borrower on the Closing Date, borrow up to such unissued or unavailable amount in the form of senior unsecured bridge loans (the Senior Unsecured Bridge Loans) under a new senior unsecured bridge loan facility described in the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility Term Sheet (the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility); ...

### 6) Sungard Conditionality

Arose out of the financing for the LBO of Sungard

Intended to tighten up conditionality, but does not go as far as Certain Funds under UK Takeover Code

Conditions to financing are limited to those expressly specified:
- Cannot introduce additional conditions by way of documentation that includes provisions that cannot be complied with at closing, e.g., by requiring accuracy of representations beyond those specified or by requiring collateral beyond those actions expressly specified
- These provisions have been incorporated into the incremental provisions in the credit agreement to apply transactions that occur after closing

Facilitates committed financings for acquisitions after closing because the committed parties do not need to underwrite refinancing of the existing facility, just the incremental debt needed for the acquisition

### 7) CP: Accuracy of Representations

Part of Sungard conditionality

Ideally, **all representations** should be required to be **made at** closing, even if only Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations and Specified Representations are required to be accurate as a condition to closing:
- Generally precedent will dictate which approach is taken

Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations should include all reps **made by or with respect to** the target in case another entity makes them on behalf of target, and should include those that must be accurate as a condition to closing or which given buyer right not to proceed to closing

> The Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations shall be true and correct. The Specified Representations shall be true and correct in all material respects.

**Specified Representations** hot buttons include:
- Patriot Act, OFAC and FCPA (latter two are often only given as to use of proceeds), foreign anti-terror/corruption/sanction reps if applicable
- Whether made by all loan parties or just Holdings and Borrower (Euro style funds certain deals want nothing regarding the condition of the Borrower Target to affect conditionality)

> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Commitment Letter (including each of the exhibits and annexes attached hereto), the Fee Letter, the Facilities Documentation or any other letter agreement or other undertaking concerning the Transactions or the financing of the Transactions to the contrary, (i) the only representations and warranties the making and the accuracy of which shall be a condition to the availability, effectiveness and funding of the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date shall be (A) such of the representations and warranties made by, or with respect to, the Target and its subsidiaries in the Acquisition Agreement as are material to the interests of the Initial Lenders, but only to the extent that you (or your affiliate) have the right (taking into account any applicable cure provisions) to terminate your (or its) obligations under the Acquisition Agreement or decline to consummate the Acquisition (in each case, in accordance with the terms thereof) as a result of a breach of any such representations and warranties in the Acquisition Agreement (to such extent, the Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations) and (B) the Specified Representations (as defined below) made in the Facilities Documentation

**Issues List**

Sungard: [LEGAL] FCPA, OFAC and sanctions subject to UoP qualifier

> For purposes hereof, Specified Representations means the representations and warranties of the Borrower and the other Guarantors (as defined in Exhibit C to this Commitment Letter); relating to the organizational existence of the Loan Parties (as defined in Exhibit B), power and authority, due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability, in each case, related to the borrowing under, guaranteeing under, performance of, and granting of security interests in the Collateral pursuant to, the Facilities Documentation; solvency as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Parent and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (solvency to be defined in a manner consistent with the manner in which solvency is determined in the solvency certificate to be delivered pursuant to paragraph 8 of Exhibit D to this Commitment Letter); Federal Reserve margin regulations; the Investment Company Act; the PATRIOT Act; the use of the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Facilities on the Closing Date not violating (x) laws applicable to sanctioned persons as administered by OFAC or the US Department of State or (y) the FCPA; the incurrence of the loans to be made under the Credit Facilities and the provision of the Guarantees (as defined in Exhibit C to this Commitment Letter) under the Credit Facilities, and the granting of the security interests in the Collateral to secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in Exhibit C to this Commitment Letter) do not conflict with the organizational documents of the Borrower or any Guarantor; and, subject to the proviso in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, creation, validity and perfection of security interests in the Collateral.

### 8) CP: Collateral

Part of Sungard conditionality

Only the collateral specified in this provision is required to be perfected at closing as a condition to closing

UCCs are relatively easy to file and should never be excluded:
- As with Specified Representations, focus on whether they are required on just the borrower and holdings or each other loan party

If the borrower has **material intellectual property,** consider whether filings with the US Patent and Trademark Office and/or the US Copyright Office should be included in this language

**Stock certificates:** Stock of the borrower (if owned by holdings, which is controlled by sponsor) should be required to be delivered as a condition, although if uncertificated (as it often is) this is not an issue

> Subject to the Limited Conditionality Provision, all documents and instruments required to create and perfect the Administrative Agents security interests in the Collateral under the Senior Secured Facilities shall have been executed and delivered and, if applicable, be in the proper form for filing... the terms of the definitive documentation for the ABL Facility shall be such that it does not impair the availability of the ABL Facility on the Closing Date if the conditions set forth in this Exhibit C, in Section 6 of the Commitment Letter and in the Term Sheet under the paragraph titled Conditions Precedent to Initial Borrowing are satisfied or waived ...

If borrowers prime asset is **real property,** discuss with client whether to require mortgages as a condition:
- This may occur with a casino or similar type deal

In a multijurisdictional deal, foreign collateral is usually post-closing, but if all assets are foreign, that should be revisited

As with Specified Representations, focus on whether UCCs are required on just the Borrower and Holdings or each other entity

**Issues List**

Sungard – Only stock of Borrower required to be delivered at closing (vs. Borrower and subs) [Magic, Connect – stock of wholly owned subs also to be delivered at close to the extent received from the Target]

> ... (it being understood that, to the extent any security interest in the intended Collateral or any deliverable related to the perfection of security interests in the intended Collateral (other than any Collateral the security interest in which may be perfected by the filing of a UCC financing statement or the possession of the stock certificates, if any, of the Company and the Target and, to the extent received from the Seller on the Closing Date after your use of commercially reasonable efforts, any domestic subsidiary of the Target), is not or cannot be provided and/or perfected on the Closing Date (1) without undue burden or expense or (2) after your use of commercially reasonable efforts to do so, then the provision and/or perfection of such security interest(s) or deliverable shall not constitute a condition precedent to the availability of the ABL Facility on the Closing Date but shall be required to be delivered after the Closing Date pursuant to arrangements and timing to be mutually agreed by the Agent and the Borrowers)

### 9) CP: Absence of Material Adverse Change (MAC or MAE)

Base measurement date is usually date of acquisition agreement and runs through closing:
- Watch out for MAE conditions that end at signing or some date earlier than closing

The acquisition agreement should include a representation or condition that there has been no MAE since the last [audited] balance sheet date (if not audited, flag to client) to the date of the acquisition agreement

Usually defined by reference to the acquisition agreement definition of MAE; if changes to MAE are not specified as changes over which commitment parties have consent rights under acquisition agreement CP, then define by reference to acquisition agreement as in effect on signing date

Even though there has been probably only one case in Delaware where a buyer was successful in terminating an acquisition agreement based on an MAE condition, this condition is very important to our clients, and its absence should be flagged

> Since the date of the Purchase Agreement, there shall not have been any change that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date hereof).

**Issues List**

MAE condition: runs from date of Acquisition Agreement [Sponsor precedent: same; well FN subject to review of Acquisition Agreement to confirm representation in Acquisition Agreement runs from last audit to signing]

### 10) CP: Financial Statements

Battle is over continuing financial information:
- Sellers often want CP limited to financial information that already exist at signing to reduce contingency
- For syndication/marketing purposes and to confirm no MAE, commitment parties want ongoing requirements (for quarters ended at least 45 or 60 days pre-closing and years ended 90-days pre-closing)

Check financial statement requirements in the acquisition agreement

If the commitment is for a bridge, the periods should align with periods that would be required for an offering

> The Financial Institutions shall have received (a) audited consolidated balance sheets and statements of income, cash flow and stockholders equity of the Target and its subsidiaries for the two most recently completed fiscal years ended at least 90 days before the Closing Date and (b) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and statements of income, cash flow and stockholders equity of the Target and its subsidiaries for each subsequent fiscal quarter ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date (other than any fiscal fourth quarter) after the most recent fiscal period for which audited financial statements have been provided pursuant to clause (a) hereof, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP.

**Issues List**

**Financial information**
- Audits for two most recent years ended 90 days before Closing Date [same as Sponsor precedent; we see 2 years often but let us know if youd like to push for 3 years]
- Quarterlies and pro formas for each quarter ended at least 45 days before Closing Date [same as Sponsor precedent]

Pro formas are something borrower has to create

Sometimes no longer included for bank-only transactions, but they can be useful as a CP as they can operate to delay the commencement of the marketing period

Compliance with Regulation S-X is typically required only for bridge commitments

> The Financial Institutions shall have received a pro forma consolidated balance sheet and a related pro forma consolidated statement of income of the Borrower and its subsidiaries (based on the financial statements of the Target referred to in paragraph 4 below) as of and for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the most recently completed four-fiscal quarter period ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date, or, if the most recently completed fiscal period is the end of a fiscal year, ended at least 90 days before the Closing Date, prepared after giving effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred as of such date (in the case of such balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in the case of such other statement of income), which reflect adjustments customary for Rule 144A transactions, it being understood that such pro forma financial statements need not be prepared in compliance with Regulation S-X of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or include adjustments for purchase accounting (including adjustments of the type contemplated by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (formerly SFAS 141R), tax adjustments, deferred taxes or other similar pro forma adjustments).

### 11) CP: Offering Document

For **bridge commitments only,** must include a CP related to delivery of an offering memorandum suitable for use in a Rule 144A offering (unless the bridge facility is expected to be funded (unusual))

Some sponsors have negotiated a commercial reasonable efforts qualifier on this CP; such qualifications should be flagged

Traditional bank commitments also included a condition for delivery of an information memorandum. This is no longer common.

**Issues List**

Offering Document: Requirement to deliver is qualified by commercially reasonable efforts standard (not flat requirement)

> As a condition to the availability of the Bridge Facility, (a) Buyer shall have provided the Investment Banks (as defined in the Fee Letter) with (i) a customary preliminary offering memorandum or customary preliminary private placement memorandum (collectively, the Offering Documents) for the Notes suitable for use in a customary high yield road show relating to the Notes and in customary form for offering memoranda used in Rule 144A for life offerings of non-convertible debt securities by portfolio company affiliates of top tier sponsors in North America, ..., and (ii) all other financial data necessary for the Investment Banks to receive customary comfort (including customary negative assurance comfort) from the independent accountants of the Target in connection with the Offering Documents, which such accountants are prepared to provide upon completion of customary procedures and the Borrower shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the delivery by such independent accountants of a draft of such comfort letter and...

### 12) CP: Marketing Period

Indicate if not included as a CP (not uncommon in bank only deals if there is an Inside Date concept (see second following slide))

Note number of days (and whether business or calendar days) and start date:
- Usually runs from delivery of financial statements / offering documents that are required as CP, but if there are no ongoing financial statements or pro forma financial statements, it will run starting after signing
- Note that the Marketing Period typically does not re-start as a result of delivery of additional financial statements, so if youre between financial statement delivery dates, the entire Marketing Period may run

If the commitment period extends over certain periods of the year, blackout periods/dates should be included:
- End of year and August recess blackouts restart marketing period if not fully elapsed

The Marketing Period concept must be reflected in acquisition agreement, and may be longer there

Occasionally qualified by commercially reasonable efforts; in such case flag the qualifier

**Issues List**

Marketing Period: business day period; includes blackout dates 8/20/21-9/8/21, //21-1/4/22, Thanksgiving; must be completed by 2/11/22 or commence after delivery of 2021 audit...

### 13) CP: Inside Date

Banks not required to fund if closing occurs before a certain date

In bank-only deals, the Inside Date may be in lieu of a Marketing Period CP:
- In many instances, may be more useful than a Marketing Period since Marketing Periods for bank only commitments can often start immediately at signing

Commitment parties disfavor closing long (i.e., with debt already funded) prior to allocation

Must be reflected in acquisition agreement itself

If there is neither a Marketing Period or Inside Date, ask client if pre-funding fee is applicable

**Issues List**

Includes an Inside Date as CP, which is blank for now (no Marketing Period condition).

### 14) CP: Loan Documentation

Credit agreement and loan documents must be executed and delivered by loan parties

Indicate if only certain loan parties are required to sign the loan documents

**Example 1:**

> Conditions Precedent. The Initial Lenders obligations to fund their respective commitments in respect of a Facility hereunder, and our agreements to perform the services described herein, are subject solely to (a) the execution and delivery by the Borrower (and Holdings, as applicable) of definitive documentation with respect to such Facility on the terms set forth in the Term Sheet applicable to such Facility, consistent with the Documentation Precedent (as defined in the Fee Letter),

**Example 2:**

**Issues List**

Loan Documentation CP: Loan documents are required to be signed by borrower and Holdings only, not all loan parties.

> The Administrative Agents shall have received the First Lien Documentation and Second Lien Documentation, as applicable, which shall be executed and delivered by the Borrower and the Guarantors.

### 15) CP: Closing Documents

**Legal Opinions:** Note any limitation as to specific jurisdiction, such as only NY or Delaware, unless existing borrower and target and all domestic target subsidiaries (as set forth in schedules to acquisition agreement) are organized in those jurisdictions

**Secretarys/Incumbency Certificates:** Needed for our clients to confirm authority and signatures

**Solvency Certificate**
- Typically the form of certificate is attached as an exhibit to the commitment letter
- Make sure no debt is carved out and covers entire pro forma entity (and does not exclude unrestricted subsidiaries)

**Borrowing Base Certificate:** For ABL transactions only, ask client if borrowing base certificate is required as CP

> Conditions Precedent to Initial Borrowing: Only the following (consistent with the Documentation Principles and subject to the last paragraph of Exhibit C): delivery of reasonably satisfactory customary (consistent with similar transactions for the Sponsor) legal opinions of counsel for the Loan Parties; a certificate from the chief financial officer of Holdings in the form attached as Exhibit D (or, at the Borrowers option, a solvency opinion from an independent investment bank or valuation firm of nationally recognized standing) with respect to Closing Date solvency (on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby); customary corporate documents and officers and public officials certifications for the Loan Parties; customary closing certificates; delivery of a borrowing base certificate; and delivery of a notice of borrowing.

### 16) CP: KYC Requirements

All financial institutions are required to complete know-your-customer due diligence requirements for their clients:
- Each financial institutions requirements may vary, and may vary for different clients

Note number of days prior to closing by which information must be requested and by when borrower must provide (typically 10 and 3 business days); note if different

In recent letters, sponsors have asked banks to present a list at signing of the commitment letter of what KYC info they will need, and only allow new requests as a result of a change in law or the banks circumstances or certain other narrow categories, such as readily available information:
- **Goal of sponsors is to reduce any contingency**

> The Administrative Agents shall have received, at least three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information about the Borrower and the Guarantors required under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and, if the Borrower qualifies as a legal entity customer under 31 C.F.R. 1010.230(the Beneficial Ownership Regulation) a certification in relation to the Borrower regarding individual beneficial ownership to the extent required by the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, that in each case has been requested in writing at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date.

### 17) CP: Payment of Fees and Expenses

Crucial—do not want borrower to object to paying any fees and expenses at closing

Expenses may be required to be invoiced; however, fees are set forth in the commitment papers and should not be required to be invoiced

Netting against proceeds of the initial borrowings under the facilities is OK, and generally preferred

> All fees required to be paid on the Closing Date in respect of the Senior Facilities pursuant to the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses required to be paid on the Closing Date pursuant to the Commitment Letter with respect to expenses, to the extent invoiced at least three business days prior to the Closing Date, shall, upon the initial borrowing under the Term Facility, have been paid (which amounts may be offset against the proceeds of the Term Facility).

### 18) CP: Due Diligence

Crucial when sending back early drafts:
- Sometimes client will also want to mention the Borrower and the Acquired Business and shall credit approval have received all necessary internal committee
- Sometimes sponsors do not want the approvals in connection with the Transactions.] hassle of diligence for an early stage bid;

## Preparing a Commitment Letter Issues List, Part IV: The Bank Term Sheet

### Overview of Part IV

This presentation will cover the following topics:
- Borrower
- Guarantees and Collateral
- Currencies
- Availability
- Letters of Credit
- Swingline Facilities
- Maturity and Amortization
- Mandatory Prepayments
- Prepayment Premiums (soft calls)

### Term Sheets Generally

Borrowers favor detail in the term sheet, as it provides them certainty on the provisions to be set forth in the definitive documentation

Banks would prefer to keep the term sheet as vague as possible and defer details to the definitive documentation:
- saves time
- allows banks to adjust the terms of the financing in case the market moves or the reception of the market to the borrower is different than expected
- The detailed term sheets that we typically encounter are the result of sponsors historical experience with skeletal term sheets, including at times of market disruptions

Now banks often underwrite (i.e., commit to lend pursuant to) virtually an entire credit agreement at the commitment letter stage

In best efforts financings, the arrangers agree to take such terms to market

Flexibility is limited to (i) where the term sheet says to be agreed and (ii) for syndicated deals, the market flex provisions of the fee letter

> For purposes of the Commitment Letter, the Term Sheets and this Fee Letter, the definitive documentation with respect to the Senior Facilities, the Securities (as defined below), the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, the Senior Unsecured Term Loans and the Senior Unsecured Exchange Notes will contain the terms set forth in the Term Sheets and will otherwise be based on and substantially consistent with the Documentation Precedent (as defined below), with such modifications as are necessary to reflect the terms set forth in the Term Sheets and to reflect administrative agency and operational matters reasonably acceptable to the applicable administrative agent and the Borrower and, for the avoidance of doubt, include customary EU bail-in provisions (including UK bail-in provisions) consistent with those in the Documentation Precedent and customary and hardwired benchmark successor rate language, erroneous payment and related agent claw-back provisions, in each case, consistent with recent precedent for the Sponsor.

### 1) Borrower

**Non-US borrower:** confirm that the guarantee and collateral package and any regulatory structural considerations have been considered

> The Company, as Lead Borrower, and one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdings, in each case organized in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong and the Netherlands and other non-US jurisdictions to be agreed (such jurisdictions, the Foreign Jurisdictions), that are designated by Holdings as additional borrowers under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) (Additional Borrowers and together with the Lead Borrower, collectively, the Borrowers), subject to, in the case of each Foreign Jurisdiction, collateral and guarantee arrangements, structural and tax considerations, and borrowing sublimits, in each case reasonably satisfactory to Holdings and the Lead Arranger, and if designated on a post-closing basis, subject to consent of the Agent and the applicable Lenders under the Revolving Facility, after receiving, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to them, all documentation and other information under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation.

**Additional borrowers after closing**
- Sometimes companies want flexibility to add other borrowers, either in the same or other jurisdictions
- A borrower may not be able to on-lend borrowings made under the credit agreement to subsidiaries in other jurisdictions where funds are needed, or where tax deductions on interest expense on the loans are desired; in such cases, the company may request the flexibility to add other borrowers, and lenders may desire to assist them in optimizing the financing structure (e.g., compressing cost of capital and taxes and enhance operating and financing flexibility)
- If a company is allowed to add additional borrowers, confirm the following:
  - they are required to be organized in the US (or the jurisdiction of the original borrower)
  - lenders are entitled to require KYC checks and information

### 2) Guarantees and Collateral

Check if Holdings guarantee is included and, if not, confirm that is the intent

Guarantees are typically limited to domestic wholly owned restricted subsidiaries:
- flag the **materiality threshold** in the documentation precedent
- If the borrower has **significant foreign operations,** discuss with your client if any foreign guarantees or collateral is expected or should be considered# Part 2 - Investment, Debt and Asset Management

## 1) Subsidiaries of foreign borrower

If the borrower is organized in a non-US jurisdiction, there should not be a blanket exclusion of non-US subsidiaries from the guarantee requirement

For a multi-jurisdictional bank financing, the documentation will likely specify jurisdictions where collateral and guarantees are required
> Consult our tax and UCC specialists; also consider if we should consult with local counsel at this time

All obligations under the ABL Facility ... will be unconditionally guaranteed (the **Guarantees**) by (i) Holdings, (ii) with respect to borrowings by an Additional Borrower and Hedging Arrangements and Cash Management Arrangements of any of its subsidiaries, the Lead Borrower and (iii) each existing and subsequently acquired or organized wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings (the **Subsidiary Guarantors** and, together with Holdings, the **Guarantors**), subject to exceptions to be agreed upon, including, without limitation, (a) subsidiaries of Holdings that are not subsidiaries organized in the United States or in any of the Foreign Jurisdictions, ...

## 2) Chewy issue *

Check if an Excluded Subsidiary would be released from its guarantee automatically (may be in the documentation precedent and not directly in the term sheet), and if any non-wholly owned subsidiary is an Excluded Subsidiary

In such case, discuss with client whether to include overriding language (see right), either in the term sheet or as a flex item

Keep in mind that addressing the Chewy issue will not address guarantee leakage for subsidiaries that are non-wholly owned at closing or when they are acquired by the borrower; this just applies to release of subsidiaries that cease to be wholly owned 

**Note:** clause (x) does not solve the Chewy issue if the investment covenant permits unlimited investments in non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries

Flex provision: add a provision applicable to the First Lien Guarantees that there shall be no automatic release of a Guarantor upon the Guarantor becoming a non-wholly owned subsidiary unless [(x) if such release of a non-wholly owned subsidiary as a Guarantor results in such Guarantor no longer being a restricted subsidiary, such release is considered to be an investment or (y)] such transaction is for a bona fide business purpose with a non-affiliate;

The Borrower may, at its option, cause any restricted subsidiary that is not otherwise required to do so to become a Guarantor with the consent of the Term Loan Administrative Agent; provided that in the case of any foreign subsidiaries, the jurisdiction of such subsidiary shall be reasonably acceptable to the Term Loan Administrative Agent, taking into account the availability and enforceability of guarantees and collateral pledges in such jurisdictions, and such foreign subsidiary shall enter into collateral documents governed by the applicable foreign law and reasonably acceptable to the Term Loan Administrative Agent.

## 3) Ability to add additional guarantors at borrowers option

Borrowers may want to add a subsidiary as a guarantor for additional flexibility for that subsidiary to incur debt (since debt at non-guarantors is more limited than at guarantors) or, if investments in non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries are limited, to receive intercompany investments

Adding guarantees may also positively affect the credit rating of the credit facility

**Foreign guarantors:** We generally require administrative agent consent for the borrower to optionally add guarantors from new foreign jurisdictions in case (i) the enforceability of the guarantee or the collateral package from subsidiaries organized in such jurisdiction would be limited, either by law or by de facto conditions in that jurisdiction, or (ii) obtaining a guarantee from an entity organized in such jurisdiction raises regulatory concerns for the administrative agent or the lenders

Subject to the exceptions described below and other exceptions to be agreed upon, the Senior Facilities, the Guarantees, and, at the option of the Borrower, any Hedging Arrangements and any Cash Management Arrangements will be, subject to the last paragraph of Exhibit E, secured by a first-priority security interest (subject to permitted liens) in (a) all of the equity interests of the Borrower directly held by Holdings and (b) substantially all the material owned assets of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, whether owned on the Closing Date or thereafter acquired (collectively, the Collateral), including but not limited to...

Watch out for any unusual exclusions to the collateral package, including in how the collateral itself is described
> Example language (on right) would include only material assets as collateral; this formulation is disfavored by lenders
flag the real property mortgage threshold (if any)
> Real property is increasingly being excluded from the collateral (largely due to regulatory burdens of obtaining real property mortgages)
> Watch out for companies where real property is the prime asset, like a casino
> Leased real property is usually excluded altogether, but flag if leased real property is mission critical (e.g., sole manufacturing plant)

## 3) Currencies

### Term Loans

Most frequently in US dollars only. Sometimes in euros, very rarely in any other currency
Detail the currencies—this will be very important to your client as it has a major impact upon syndication strategy and also has a credit angle in terms of matching borrower cash flows with like-currency interest and amortization payments without need for hedging
If the borrower is allowed to elect between currencies for a tranche between signing and closing, this will be very important to your client, as it can affect U.S. dollar-denominated commitment amounts o If the borrower can decide post-signing to switch from USD to euros or another currency, your client must know – do not skimp on detail on this point!

### Revolving Facility (aka Revolver)

flag all specified currencies other than US dollars
If the borrower is permitted to add additional currencies after the closing date, confirm that all revolving lenders and the administrative agent have the right to approve them
Availability of letters of credit in non-US currencies should be approved by the letter of credit issuer
If the revolver is very large, sometimes it will be broken up into a US dollar facility and multicurrency facility to allow certain banks to participate in USD-only tranche

## 4) Availability

### Term Loan

Except for delayed draw term loans, should be drawn in full in a single drawing at closing
flag if it can be used for purposes other than the Transactions and Transaction Costs (acquisition and refinancing and fees related thereto)
> Term Loans for general corporate purposes, working capital or future acquisitions may indicate that the company is being over-levered, the revolver is too small, or another issue

### Revolving Facility

Use at closing is limited if capital structure assumed no revolver draw
Also, lenders want the revolving facility to be available for ongoing liquidity
Typical permitted uses at closing:
> OID imposed pursuant to the flex or securities demand, under the theory that the borrower is getting less proceeds than it planned (but not all 1D)
> ordinary course working capital

Upon satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth under Conditions to Each Borrowing below, borrowings may be made under the Revolving Facility at any time after the Closing Date but excluding the business day preceding the Revolving Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon satisfaction or waiver of the Specified Conditions, borrowings may be made under the Revolving Facility and Letters of Credit may be issued on the Closing Date to

(i) cash collateralize, replace or back-stop existing letters of credit and/or bank guarantees of the Acquired Business,

( ) fund the amount of any original issue discount or upfront fees imposed pursuant to the market flex provisions of the Fee Letter and (iii) pay the Acquisition consideration, fund the Refinancing and/or pay costs in connection with the Transaction (including purchase price and working capital adjustments) and for other general corporate purposes, in an amount not to exceed, with respect to this clause (iii), an amount to be agreed.

## 5) Letters of Credit (LCs)

### Issuing Banks

The issuing bank is taking credit risk vis-a-vis the revolving lenders because of their participation obligations, which may result in a capital charge
> If your bank is expected to be the administrative agent, flag if other revolving lenders (or revolving lenders that are affiliated with the lead arrangers) should share in the issuing bank responsibility o Borrowers often disfavor this, since it requires them to approach multiple banks for their LC needs and could require them to split up large LCs among multiple issuing banks

### Currencies

flag if LCs are permitted to be denominated in any non-USD currency

### Standby vs. Commercial/Trade LCs

Some commitment parties, especially those that are not traditional commercial banks, do not have the operational capabilities to handle commercial LCs, so they may need to have the ability to opt out of commercial LCs

At the Borrower's option, the letter of credit sub-facility may be used to issue either letters of credit or, through an issuer's affiliates, bank guarantees (and bank guarantees shall be subject to the internal policies and procedures of each Issuing Bank (as defined below) including if such internal policies and procedures do not permit the issuance of bank guarantees).

### Bank Guarantees

Sometimes term sheets (or the precedent credit agreement) include language that would obligate issuing banks to issue bank guarantees or other similar instruments
Bank guarantees are common in some European jurisdictions, but not in the US
Many of our banking clients are not able to issue bank guarantees because of their indefinite term (no specified expiration date)
Look out for any language that defines letter of credit to include other instruments and flag on the issues list

## 6) Swingline Facility

### Sub-facility

If your bank is expected to be the administrative agent, flag if it is willing to provide a swingline
Some banks strongly prefer to provide same-day base rate loans only instead of a swingline

### Currency

If any of the swingline is proposed to be available in any currency other than US dollars, flag on the issues list

## 7) Maturity and Amortization

flag if there is any deviation from the below standard terms (unless previously agreed in the business grid
Highlight any significant outstanding debt that would mature before your committed facility; a springing maturity may be appropriate
On amortization, flag the first amortization payment date if a full fiscal quarter after closing would pass with no payment

* Amortization is always based on a percentage of the original principal amount at closing, not on the declining amount

## 8) Mandatory Prepayments

### (1) Asset Sales

Purpose is to require reducing credit agreement debt if the company sells cash flow generating assets
Potential issues
> **Stepdowns** based on a leverage ratio: excess cash flow sweeps always had stepdowns, but asset sale steps are relatively new, so there is almost always flex to remove them. If there is no flex, flag.
> Whether it captures asset sales of borrower and its restricted subsidiaries or just loan parties or borrower and subsidiary guarantors. flag if the sweep covers only loan parties
> Whether it captures all property or just collateral, so even if it covers the loan parties, we would want the sweep to cover all assets of the loan parties, not just collateral (since significant items, such as real estate, could be excluded from the collateral). flag if it is just collateral
> flag minimum annual exclusion
Reinvestment period
> If the period is beyond months + 6 months if commitment to reinvest is entered into during the month period, sometimes there is flex to shorten
> If the period is longer than 18 months + 6 months, flag
Some sponsors are asking for the ability to sell (or just dividend out directly, such as a valuable Internet component of a business) certain lines of business and, so long as some leverage test is satisfied or does not get worse, either retain the proceeds or dividend them. Should be on issues list regardless of precedent as your client may need flex

**Note:** Excluded Asset Sale Proceeds build the Cumulative Credit builder (but if the flex is exercised to remove the stepdowns, this prong in the definition of Cumulative Credit would also be deleted)

**Flex provision:** with respect to the mandatory prepayments from proceeds of asset sales described under Mandatory Prepayments in Exhibit B of the Commitment Letter, (1) remove or modify the step-downs based on the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio levels and/or (2) reduce the reinvestment period from 18 months to months;

**Example:** 100% (with reductions to 50% and 0% if the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio is less than X.XX:1.0and X.XX:1.00, respectively (the excluded amount of such net cash proceeds after applying such reduction (if any), Excluded Asset Sale Proceeds)) of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (including insurance and condemnation proceeds) in excess of $XX million in the aggregate per fiscal year and subject to the right of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to reinvest such proceeds if such proceeds are reinvested (or committed to be reinvested) within 18 months and, if so committed to reinvestment, reinvested within 6 months after such initial 18 month period, and other exceptions to be agreed upon, calculated net of, among other things, any taxes (and other costs), including withholding taxes, incurred in connection with such sale or the distribution of such net sale proceeds to the Borrower, whether or not in fact distributed

### (2) Excess Cash Flow (ECF)

Original purpose was to require borrower to use a portion of excess cash to prepay debt rather than spend all excess cash on investments, capex, restricted payments, etc.
In many credit agreements in the current market, definition of Excess Cash Flow has many deductions that result in ECF being a very small amount, or the ECF payment being reduced by deductions in the mandatory prepayment section
  > Result is that borrowers often don't end up making any ECF prepayments
  > However, lenders still expect to see the ECF provision, and it is more important in middle market transactions
  > Remember that if the Cumulative Credit is built from retained ECF, a lower ECF also results in a smaller Cumulative Credit build from retained ECF
Prepayment amount is usually 50% of ECF, with stepdowns to 25% and 0% at 0.5x below and 1.0x below closing date first lien leverage ratios

**Example**: commencing with the first full fiscal year of the Borrower to occur after the Closing Date, 50.0% of Excess Cash Flow, with a reduction to 25.0% and 0.0% based upon achievement of Total Net First Lien Leverage Ratios not exceeding X.XX:1.0and X.XX:1.00, respectively; provided that (i) any voluntary prepayments of the First Lien Term Loans, any First Lien Incremental Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Facility and any Incremental Revolving Facility (in the case of any revolving credit facility, to the extent accompanied by an equivalent permanent reduction of the relevant commitment) made during such fiscal year or after year-end and prior to the time such Excess Cash Flow prepayment is due (without duplication in any other Excess Cash Flow period), other than prepayments funded with the proceeds of incurrences of long term indebtedness (other than indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Facility or any Incremental Revolving Facility), in each case shall be credited against excess cash flow prepayment obligations on a dollar-for-dollar basis (provided that, in the case of any such prepayments made at a discount to par pursuant to any permitted loan buyback, only the purchase price (and not the par amount) applicable thereto shall be so credited);

### (2) Potential issues

... any such Excess Cash Flow prepayments shall be required only to the extent Excess Cash Flow exceeds $XX for the applicable period;

Ask your client if flex to 75% is needed, particularly in riskier and smaller deals
Confirm first ECF period, especially if closing date may occur toward the beginning of a fiscal year
Check the deductions after the ECF is calculated (which deductions would reduce the ECF prepayment dollar-for-dollar) vs deductions within the definition of ECF
flag de minimis exclusion amount. Be aware that a de minimis threshold based on the ECF prepayment amount (as opposed to the amount of ECF) means that the borrower could always evade the ECF sweep with a large enough voluntary prepayment in advance to reduce the ECF prepayment amount (but many sponsor letters work this way)

**Second Lien Facilities**

> Sometimes there is no ECF sweep in the second lien, but flag if this is the case, as your client may want it or flex to add
> Confirm that declined amounts from the 1L are offered to the 2L before being retained by the borrower

### (3) Debt Sweep

Generally applies only to debt not permitted by the credit agreement, other than Refinancing Facilities
Usually uncontroversial, but note if there is no debt sweep
Should not be subject to right of lenders to decline 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money by the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries (other than indebtedness permitted under the First Lien Documentation, except in respect of First Lien Refinancing Facilities)...

Any First Lien Lender may elect not to accept any mandatory prepayment (other than with respect to First Lien Refinancing Facilities). Any prepayment amount declined by a First Lien Lender pursuant to a mandatory prepayment under the First Lien Term Loan Facility or by a lender or holder of First Lien Pari Passu Indebtedness (collectively, Declined Proceeds) pursuant to a mandatory prepayment, redemption or offer applicable to such First Lien Pari Passu Indebtedness shall be applied to any mandatory prepayments required under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility or other permitted second-lien or other junior indebtedness. In the event that any Second Lien Lender or other holder of such permitted second-lien or other junior indebtedness elects not to accept its pro rata portion of any mandatory prepayment from such Declined Proceeds, such amounts may be retained by the Borrower.

### (4) Prepayment Premiums

Floating rate debt traditionally did not need call protection because there was not the risk of borrowers taking advantage of lower interest rates in the market and refinancing early since the rates automatically reset lower
First lien lenders generally expect them in case the yield in the market applicable to the borrower would decrease shortly after closing and borrower attempts to refinance.
Like an MFN in the incremental provisions, the decrease has to be measured in effective yield, not just interest margin (otherwise the borrower could offer the debt at a premium to lower the yield)

**For a Term Loan B,** the standard is a 101% soft call
> Its a soft call because it is not payable under all prepayment scenarios, but only in the event of a refinancing with specific type of other debt for purpose of lowering the yield
> Confirm that soft call applies for at least months following closing or there is flex to make it months The Borrower shall pay a prepayment premium in connection with any Repricing Event (as defined below) with respect to all or any portion of the Term Loans that occurs on or before the date that is six months after the Closing Date, in an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the Term Facility subject to such Repricing Event.
Flex provision: extend the prepayment premium applicable to the Term Facility in the event of a Repricing Event until the -month anniversary of the Closing Date;
Potential issues in soft call provisions
> Make sure it applies if the term loan is refinanced in whole or part
> What type of refinancing debt triggers it: typically secured term loans
> Common transactions in connection with which refinancings of the **TLB** do not trigger the soft call: qualified IPO, Change of Control and Transformative Acquisition.
> flag any other exception from soft call (such as dividend recapitalizations)

The term Repricing Event shall mean (i) any voluntary prepayment or repayment of Term Loans with the proceeds of, or any conversion of Term Loans into, any new or replacement tranche of long-term secured term loans that are broadly s is to banks and other institutional investors in financings similar to the Term Loans bearing interest with an effective yield that is less than the yield applicable to the Term Loans and (ii) any amendment to the Term Facility which reduces the yield applicable to the Term Loans (it being understood that (x) any prepayment premium with respect to a Repricing Event shall apply to any required assignment by a non-consenting Lender in connection with any such amendment pursuant to so-called yank-a-bank procedures and (y) in each case, the yield shall include upfront fees and original issue discount on customary terms and any interest rate floor, but exclude any structuring, ticking, commitment, amendment and arranger fees or other similar fees unless such similar fees are paid to all lenders generally in the primary syndication of such new or replacement tranche of term loans), other than, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), in connection with a qualified IPO, a change in control or a transformative acquisition (each such term to be defined in a manner consistent with the Documentation Precedent).

# Preparing a Commitment Letter Issues List, Part V:

## Overview of Part V

This presentation will cover the following sections of the bank term sheet:

### Prepayment Provisions: Hard Call

### Representations and Warranties

### Conditions Precedent

### Affirmative Covenants

### Incremental Provisions

### Refinancing Facilities 

## Non-Term Loan B Prepayment Premiums

**Revolvers and term A loans** generally do not have prepayment premiums (except in truly small private deals)

**Second lien facilities** generally have hard call (all voluntary and mandatory prepayments other than from ECF and asset sale proceeds trigger premium)
> flag if any exception is proposed, and discuss whether flex is needed for the call schedule/premium amount
> **Direct lender deals** often have specifically negotiated prepayment premiums that are more lender-favorable than in the syndicated market but recently do often carve out change of control and IPO events

## 9) Representation and Warranties

### Holdings

Make sure Holdings makes representations about its guarantee and certain customary matters

### Anti-Terrorism, Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Laws

Usually would like all three as stand-alone rather than just part of compliance with law rep; banks may feel more strongly depending on the risk profile (large international operations)
Include Patriot Act, OFAC, FCPA and Beneficial Ownership Certificate
> For deals with foreign elements, add foreign anti'adterrorism, sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering
> Ideally covers unrestricted subsidiaries (especially if the Documentation Precedent does so)

With Russian invasion of Ukraine, there may be a heightened focus

Only the following representations and warranties will apply (to be applicable to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and, with respect to customary representations with respect to the validity of the Guarantee by Holdings and certain other customary representations consistent with the Documentation Precedent, Holdings [and unrestricted subsidiaries]), subject to exceptions and qualifications consistent with the Documentation Precedent and other exceptions and qualifications to be agreed upon: organization, existence, and power; qualification; authorization and enforceability; no conflict; governmental consents; subsidiaries; accuracy of financial statements and other information in all material respects; projections; no material adverse change; absence of litigation; compliance with laws; compliance with PATRIOT Act, Beneficial Ownership Regulation, OFAC, ERISA, margin regulations, environmental laws, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and laws with respect to sanctioned persons and any applicable anti-corruption laws; taxes; ownership of properties; governmental regulation; inapplicability of the Investment Company Act; closing date solvency on a consolidated basis; labor matters; validity, priority and perfection of security interests in the Collateral; intellectual property; treatment as designated senior debt under subordinated debt documents (if any); use of proceeds; and insurance.

### Historical Financial Statements

> Some forms do not include this in an acquisition financing under the theory that the target was under different ownership at the time and they cannot rep as to financials of a company they did not manage; this raises the issue of risk allocation (i.e., who should bear this kind of risk, the borrower or the lenders)
> flag if missing; sometimes a knowledge qualifier is agreed upon

### Solvency

> Make sure there is one and covers borrower and its subsidiaries (not just restricted subsidiaries)
> Usually limited to solvency as of the closing date

Check list of representations against documentation precedent and against a standard list to confirm nothing is missing

## 10) Conditions to Each Credit Extension

Should apply to borrowing of any loan and any new letter of credit or any extension or increase in a letter of credit
> Subject to Sungard conditionality for credit extensions on the closing date of a committed financin
The following are standard conditions; flag any deviation
> **No default or event of default** has occurred and is continuing (note this should not be limited to just absence of event of default)
> Representations and warranties being true and correct in all material respects
> Delivery of borrowing notice (or letter of credit application)

## 11) Affirmative Covenants

Check list of affirmative covenants against documentation precedent and against a standard list to confirm nothing is missing

### (1) Reporting

Confirm annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements are required, and that compliance certificates are delivered each year and quarter (should be delivered even if there are no financial covenants or the financial covenant would not be tested so that borrower can certify to no default periodically in the absence of a borrowing)

Check audit qualifications

Sponsors are objecting to annual budget/projections; flag if not included

flag any unusually long grace periods if specified

Only the following affirmative covenants will apply (to be applicable to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and, to the extent consistent with the Documentation Precedent, Holdings), subject to customary exceptions and qualifications, exceptions and qualifications consistent with the Documentation Precedent and other baskets, exceptions and qualifications to be agreed upon: maintenance of corporate existence and rights; performance and payment of obligations; delivery of annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements (accompanied by customary management discussion and analysis and (annually) by an audit opinion from nationally recognized auditors that is not subject to any qualification as to scope of such audit or going concern on a consolidated basis (other than with respect to, or resulting from, an upcoming maturity date under any series of indebtedness, any breach of a financial maintenance covenant or any potential inability to satisfy a financial maintenance covenant on a future date or in a future period)) (with extended time periods for delivery of the first annual and certain agreed quarterly financial statements to be delivered after the Closing Date) and an annual budget; quarterly compliance certificates of the most recently ended quarter...

### (2) MD&A Lender calls

Sponsors resist these since one of the prime attractions of going private is that MD&A and public investor calls are no longer required, but lenders value the updates
Often there is flex to one or the other
flag if not listed

### (3) Credit Ratings

Institutional term loans include a covenant to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain credit ratings (though not at a specific level)
flag if not included, unless parties have agreed not to obtain ratings (e.g., because the deal is not being syndicated)
Credit ratings are usually not required in **direct lender deals**

Flex provision: with respect to the Affirmative Covenants in Exhibit B of the Commitment Letter, add a requirement to hold quarterly conference calls for Lenders at the request of the Senior Facilities Agent Only the following affirmative covenants will apply (to be applicable to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and, to the extent consistent with the Documentation Precedent, Holdings), subject to customary exceptions and qualifications, exceptions and qualifications consistent with the Documentation Precedent and other baskets, exceptions and qualifications to be agreed upon: ... commercially reasonable efforts to maintain ratings (but not a specific rating); compliance with laws; compliance with PATRIOT Act, FCPA and any applicable anti-corruption laws, including Beneficial Ownership Regulation, OFAC and other laws with respect to sanctions; providing updated customary KYC information; ...

### (4) Notices

...delivery of notices of default and material adverse litigation, ERISA events and material adverse change; maintenance of properties in good working order; maintenance of books and records; maintenance of customary insurance; inspection of books and properties; environmental; additional guarantors and additional collateral (subject to limitations set forth under the captions **Guarantees** and **Security**); further assurances in respect of collateral matters; use of proceeds; and payment of taxes...
Instead of notices of **default,** some firms have now been asking for notices of **events of default** under the theory that the quarterly compliance certificates states that there is no 
> This is problematic if a default requires notice from the administrative agent or the lenders in order to mature into an event of default (since the agent and lenders would not know to give notice of default)
> In many cases only the borrower would know if it is in default (such as when it has formed a new subsidiary and not provided a guarantee that was required)
Litigation and ERISA events are usually also included, since those can result in a lien against the borrowers assets

### (5) Use of proceeds

Make sure this is either in the affirmative covenants or the reps

## 12) Incremental Provisions (aka the Accordion)

Allows the borrower to incur additional debt under the credit agreement without consent of existing lenders
> Borrowers may seek incremental loans from existing lenders and/or new lenders
> In private deals only, existing lenders often get right of first refusal so their voting stake in the debt does not get diluted
Items of focus are
> total amount of incremental facilities permitted (aka incremental capacity), which is typically based on a ratio prong + non-ratio components
> limitations on the terms of incremental facilities

## 2) Non-Ratio Component (AKA Fixed Amount Component)

### (1) Free and Clear component

Usually the greater of (x) 100% EBITDA as of the closing date (a fixed dollar amount) and (y) 100% of EBITDA for the four quarter period preceding the determination date **(LTM EBITDA)**

> Basket can grow over time with growth of EBITDA
> Often there is flex to reduce both prongs to 75%
In first lien/second lien deals, note that the free and clear component is usually shared between the first and second lien credit agreements, but flag to your client if not
Sometimes also includes the unused portion of the general debt basket, which may be reallocated to the incremental capacity; also in some more aggressive deals, ability to reallocate general RP and Available Amount baskets to incremental capacity
> If this prong is included, usually there is flex to remove this prong

an amount (the First Lien Fixed Incremental Amount) equal to (I) the greater of (x) a fixed amount equal to 1.0x Closing Date EBITDA and (y) 100% of pro forma EBITDA (as defined below) at the time of incurrence, less (II) the aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Incremental Debt and Second Lien Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred in reliance on the Second Lien Fixed Incremental Amount, plus (III) the then unused portion of the General Debt Basket (as defined below) (the **General Basket Incremental Reallocation Incremental Prong**)...

### (2) Prepayment component

Prepayments of term loans under credit agreement and certain other debt increase incremental capacity
Should be limited to voluntary prepayments: if a mandatory prepayment event increases incremental capacity, the mandatory prepayment would be meaningless; however, this has crept in some letters recently—flag this issue
Prepayment of second lien, unsecured or non-first lien debt should not increase first lien capacity – although a number of larger sponsors have negotiated away this restriction
Should exclude prepayments made with long-term debt: refinancing with long-term debt is not a de-leveraging event and should not increase borrowing capacity
flag if discounted buybacks are given credit for the full face amount, rather than being limited to the amount actually paid the aggregate amount of all voluntary prepayments of the First Lien Facilities

(with respect to the First Lien Revolving Facility, to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction of the revolving commitments thereunder) or First Lien Incremental Debt (in each case, to the extent secured on a pari passu basis with the First Lien Facilities) prior to such date of incurrence (other than to the extent such voluntary prepayment is funded with proceeds of long-term debt (other than revolving loans)), additional debt buybacks of loans under the First Lien Term Facility permitted under the First Lien Facility Documentation (to the extent of the actual amount of cash paid), payments utilizing the yank-a-bank provisions of the First Lien Facility Documentation, and, solely with respect to the applicable extension debt and without duplication, such portion of outstanding loans under the First Lien Facilities effectively extended pursuant to any applicable First Lien Incremental Debt

## 3) Ratio Component

Incremental facility is permitted if after giving effect thereto a specified ratio is not exceeded
The type of ratio usually depends on the type of debt comprising the incremental facility:

| Type of Debt | Ratio Type | Opening ratio |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| First lien secured | First lien secured ratio | Opening ratio |
| Junior lien secured | Total secured ratio | Opening ratio [+ cushion] |
| Unsecured | Total leverage ratio or Interest/fixed charge coverage ratio or Best of either ratio | Opening ratio [+ cushion] 2.00:1.0(sometimes 1.75:1.0with flex to increase to 2.00:1.0and/or remove coverage ratio prong) |

First lien leverage ratio prong is usually **opening first lien leverage ratio** (closing date leverage **after giving effect to the Transactions**)

> If the proposed ratio is outside (higher than) the opening first lien leverage, flag it on the issues list and often need flex to bring ratio inside

Total secured ratio prong is usually **opening total secured leverage ratio** (which will be the same as opening first lien leverage unless there is a second lien or secured notes or a bridge), **plus** some cushion

> In first lien/second lien deals, flag if there is a cushion to opening leverage on the secured leverage test on the second lien credit agreement

Total leverage ratio prong is usually **opening total leverage ratio** (which will be the same as opening first lien leverage only if there is no other funded term debt in the capital structure (such a structure is called a stretch first lien or stretch bank); in a first lien/second lien or first lien/secured notes deal, it is the same as total closing secured leverage), **plus** some cushion

(A) an unlimited amount (the Incurrence Incremental Amount) at any time so long as, (x) **in the case of First Lien Incremental Debt secured by the Collateral on a** **pari passu** **basis with the First Lien Facilities,** the First Lien Leverage Ratio shall be no greater than (1) 0.25x outside the Closing Date First Lien Leverage Ratio or (2) in the case of any such First Lien Incremental Debt incurred in connection with any acquisition or similar investment not prohibited by the First Lien Facility Documentation, the Closing Date First Lien Leverage Ratio and the level at the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter prior to such transaction, (y) **in the case of First Lien Incremental Debt secured by liens on Collateral that are** **pari passu** **with or junior to the liens of the Second Lien Term Facility,** the Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined below) shall be no greater than (1) 0.5x outside the Closing Date Secured Leverage Ratio or (2) in the case of any such First Lien Incremental Debt incurred in connection with any acquisition or similar investment not prohibited by the First Lien Facility Documentation, the Closing Date Secured Leverage Ratio and the level at the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter prior to such transaction...

in the case of unsecured First Lien Incremental Debt, at the Borrowers option, either (i) the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined below) shall not exceed (1) 0.50x outside the Closing Date Total Leverage Ratio or (2) in the case of any such First Lien Incremental Debt incurred in connection with any acquisition or similar investment not prohibited by the First Lien Facility Documentation, the greater of 0.50x outside the Closing Date Total Leverage Ratio and the level at the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter prior to such transaction, or (ii) the Interest Coverage Ratio is greater than or equal to (1) 1.75:1.0or (2) in the case of any such First Lien Incremental Debt incurred in connection with any acquisition or similar investment not prohibited by the First Lien Facility Documentation, the lesser of (x) 1.75:1.0or (y) the level at the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter prior to such transaction, in each case, calculated on an Incremental Pro Forma Basis

### (1) No worse prong

Allows an incremental facility if the relevant leverage ratio does not increase after giving effect to such incremental facility
Availability of this prong had been limited to funding acquisitions, but they are now sometimes available for any funding, with flex to remove the no worse prong or to limit its use to acquisitions
Direct lenders very much dislike this provision, but it is slowly creeping into private deals
Interest coverage or fixed charge coverage is traditionally only for unsecured debt and also may have a no worse prong
> In the past few years, junior secured debt can often be incurred using it; your client may want flex to remove ability to incur secured debt under the coverage ratio
> Since a FCCR test is a relatively loose test (as it only usually captures cash interest in the denominator and not other items added back to EBITDA or other recurring costs), sometimes there is flex to remove the coverage prong entirely

### (2) Debt

Generally includes just debt for borrowed money and capital leases, but sometimes capital leases are not included either
Sometimes excludes certain types of debt, such as revolver borrowings used for working capital
In energy and more conservative lending spaces, undrawn letters of credit may be captured.
For **first lien term loan/ABL structures,** ensure that first lien leverage includes debt under the ABL
> Term loans and ABLs will have different priority collateral over which they will have the first lien, but both should be considered first lien debt
> Sponsor drafts often omit this point, so make sure it is clear and raise it to your client if not

**Total Leverage Ratio** means, at any date of determination, the ratio of (a) Consolidated Debt to (b) EBITDA for the test period then most recently ended for which financial statements have been delivered or were required to be delivered.

**Consolidated Debt** means the outstanding principal amount of debt for borrowed money (including any unreimbursed obligations in respect drawn letters of credit but excluding undrawn letters of credit), purchase money debt and capital lease obligations, minus the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (provided that any cash pledged to secure any such debt shall be deemed unrestricted only in respect of the debt secured thereby); provided further that for purposes of calculating any ratio-based debt basket, the proceeds from the incurrence of debt pursuant such basket shall not be counted for purposes of the cash netting provisions of this definition.

## 4) Ratio Calculations

Most ratios are net ratios, meaning that the amount of debt is reduced by cash and cash equivalents of the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries
> Rationale is that such cash could be used to repay debt
Only unrestricted cash (or debt pledged in favor of the collateral agent under the credit agreement) should be permitted to be netted against debt: restricted cash (e.g., cash on deposit with a landlord) is not available to reduce debt.
Proceeds of the incremental facility itself should not be permitted to be netted
> Otherwise, the borrower could incur the incremental facility, and temporarily leave the proceeds on the balance sheet; the net leverage ratio would be unchanged in such case as a result of being artificially understated. The borrower could use the proceeds later to fund a dividend or for some other purpose.
> Some borrowers have added language that proceeds not being applied to working capital or to a specified purpose can be netted. There are various formulations, but look to precedents and discuss with partner if you are not clear
The following would be unusual in large sponsor deals but may be appropriate to consider particularly in middle-market deals:
> whether to cap the total amount of cash that is permitted to be netted against debt
> if the company has material non-US businesses, whether cash of only the borrower and its US restricted subsidiaries, or only the borrower and subsidiary guarantors should be permitted to be netted against debt (assuming on the date of incurrence, in the case of any Incremental Facilities constituting revolving credit facilities, that such incurred facilities were fully drawn on the date of effectiveness thereof)
If an **incremental revolver** is being established, ratio should be tested assuming the incremental revolver is fully drawn: an undrawn revolver would not be indicative of forward debt capacity since it could be fully drawn the next day and greatly change the leverage test
Some sponsors will ask for cash of Holdings to be able to be netted since it is a guarantor even if it is just subject to the passive holdco covenant and not any of the restrictive covenants, and so could send that cash out the next day without restriction. If the letters or the precedent includes this, flag on issues list 

**Cash Netting Consolidated Debt** means the outstanding principal amount of debt for borrowed money (including any unreimbursed obligations in respect drawn letters of credit but excluding undrawn letters of credit), purchase money debt and capital lease obligations, minus the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (provided that any cash pledged to secure any such debt shall be deemed unrestricted only in respect of the debt secured thereby); provided further that for purposes of calculating any ratio-based debt basket, the proceeds from the incurrence of debt pursuant such basket shall not be counted for purposes of the cash netting provisions of this definition.

## 5) Limitations On Incremental Facilities

Incremental facility cannot have **guarantors** that the initial facility does not have, and cannot have **collateral** that the initial facility does not have
> Incremental facility should not be structurally or effectively senior to initial facility
> flag if the restrictions are limited to guarantees by restricted subs (so unrestricted subs could still provide guarantees) or assets of loan parties (so assets of non-guarantors could still be used for collateral)
> In rare deals, there is a specifically negotiated basket for structurally and effectively senior debt, often called the Designated Alternative Security basket – such a basket should be flagged and subject to flex 

Incremental facility should **not mature before initial facility** because earlier maturity would effectively make the incremental facility senior to the initial facility
> Sponsors have negotiated an exception to this general rule, called the **Inside Maturity Basket**
Inside Maturity Basket is often expressed as the greater of a fixed dollar amount and a grower prong
Our clients usually expect to have market flex to remove this concept or at least to reduce the basket
If there are interim scheduled payments of principal (such as amortization), the weighted average life to maturity is shorter than the final maturity 5
Incremental provisions should require that the WALM of the incremental facility not be shorter than the initial facility so that the maturity limitation isn't circumvented with high amortization payments on the incremental facility

(v) the First Lien Incremental Facilities (1) will rank pari passu in right of payment and pari passu with respect to security with the other First Lien Facilities, and (2) will be (x) secured by the same collateral and (y) guaranteed by the same guarantors, in each case, as the other First Lien Facilities;

(v) the loans under the additional term loan facilities will mature no earlier than, and will have a weighted average life to maturity no shorter than, that of the Term Facility and all other terms of any such additional term loan facility (other than pricing, amortization, maturity, participation in mandatory prepayments or ranking as to security) shall be substantially similar to the Term Facility or otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Senior Facilities Agent; provided that the limitations set forth in this clause (v) with respect to maturity and weighted average life to maturity shall not apply to Incremental Facilities in an aggregate principal amount outstanding not to exceed the Incremental Inside Maturity Date Debt Cap

Incremental Inside Maturity Date Debt Cap shall mean the greater of $XX and 1.00x of LTM EBITDA.

Flex: reduce the Incremental Inside Maturity Date Debt Cap from the greater of $XX and 1.00x of LTM EBITDA to the greater of $XX and 0.50x of LTM EBITDA

## 6) MFN (Most Favored Nation) Pricing Provisions

Comes from the most favored nation concept in the world of international trade

**General** **concept** is that the borrower will not pay a higher yield on incremental loans than the yield paid on the closing date loans
> If incremental loans would have a higher yield, the yield on the closing date loans is required to be increased (the transition to SOFR will make comparing yields harder)
Lenders do not want to be the stupid money, particularly if the borrower negotiated for a favorable rate
> Also if incremental loans have a higher yield than the closing date loans, the closing date loans will trade at a discount, and the lenders may need to recognize an accounting loss
Restricts borrowers ability to incur additional loans after closing since market conditions may have changed since closing and new loans may require increased yield
> The MFN provision could cause the existing term loans to be repriced
Current MFN provisions recognize these competing interests so the general concept is subject to various qualifications and exceptions, and the negotiation is over these qualifications and exceptions

## 7) MFN Provisions

### Scope / Exceptions

Applies only to incremental term loans that are pari passu with closing date term loans
MFNs typically do not provide protection against higher priced bonds or revolving facilities
Applies only to **syndicated** incremental facilities
Applies only to **floating rate** term loans
Applies only to incrementals incurred under the free and clear and prepayment prongs or only to incrementals incurred under the ratio prong
Does not apply if incremental facility is **incurred to fund an acquisition**
Does not apply if incremental facility **matures outside of original loan**
Your client may want flex to remove this exception or to specify that MFN applies unless the incremental facility matures more than [2] years after original loan
Applies only to **USD-denominated** loans
If a closing date loan is denominated in a non-USD currency, this provision needs to be modified to cover such other currency
Applies only to **Term B** loans: Be clear on what term B loans means 

### Second Lien Term Loans

Sometimes don't include MFN protection; flag to your client even if the precedent works that way; it is an aggressive term and your client may need flex out of it
If the 2L is intended to benefit from MFN protection, make sure that 2L incremental loans are required to be incurred under the 2L credit agreement (which has MFN provisions), or that any 2L term loans incurred under the 1L credit agreement are subject to the MFN provision in the 2L credit agreement 7

### Yield vs. Interest Rate

In addition to interest, lenders may be compensated by receiving an upfront fee or by funding a loan at a discount to par (sometimes referred to as **OlD**)
Such fee or yield should be taken into account in determining whether an incremental term loan has higher pricing than the closing date loans
If the MFN applies only to interest margin (and not the yield), flag on issues list

## 8) MFN Cushion

An incremental term loan is permitted to have 50-10basis points of additional yield compared to the closing date term loans
Typically banks have flex to reduce any cushion greater than 5basis points 8

## 9) MFN Sunset

MFN provision falls away after a specified period after closing
Your client may want flex to keep the MFN provision indefinitely or at least 2 years

## 10) MFN Threshold Amount

an amount below which the MFN provision does not apply
may be an individual threshold or aggregate threshold (usually individual)

## 13) Refinancing Facilities

Purpose is to allow the borrower to refinance the term loans or revolving facility in whole or part while leaving the rest of the credit agreement outstanding
> Borrower does not have to meet any financial metric or use any debt basket to do so
Like incremental facilities, a refinancing facility should not have **guarantors** that the initial facility does not have, and should not have **collateral** that the initial facility does not have
> Refinancing facility should not be structurally or effectively senior to initial facility
Like incremental facilities, a refinancing facility should **not mature before initial facility** because earlier maturity would effectively make the refinancing facility senior to the initial facility
> Refinancing facility should also not have shorter weighted average life to maturity than initial facility
> Usually the Inside Maturity Basket is available for refinancing facilities
Unlike incremental facilities, a refinancing facility is not subject to MFN pricing provisions because refinancing is not a leveraging event (and generally better for the borrowers creditworthiness, particularly if maturity is being extended even if pricing increases)# Part 3 - Investments and Restricted Payments

## (2) Permitted Acquisitions

### Requirements
- The target of the acquisition operates in a similar business
- The acquisition target becomes a guarantor and its assets and equity interests are pledged as part of the collateral to the extent required by the guarantee and collateral covenant, often with a cap on acquisitions of entities that do not become guarantors

This concept is typically relevant in credit agreements only

## (3) General Investments Basket:

Could be used for any investment. This and the other baskets often include a grower based on a percentage of EBITDA or total assets

## (4) Ratio Exception for Unlimited Investments:

Typically based on a total net leverage ratio

## (5) Builder Basket

- Available for Restricted Payments, Investments and Restricted Debt Payments
- May have a leverage governor for used of certain components of the Builder Basket
- Governor is least restrictive for use of Builder Basket for Investments, compared to other used

> (u) Investments in an aggregate amount pursuant to this clause (u) (valued at the time of the making thereof) not to exceed the Cumulative Credit immediately prior to the time of the making of such Investment; provided that if such Investment is made pursuant to this clause (u) (other than (x) any Investment made using the portion of the Cumulative Credit described in clause (a) of the definition thereof, in which case no Specified Event of Default [bankruptcy or payment] shall have occurred and be continuing, or (y) any Investment made using the portion of the Cumulative Credit described in clause (b) of the definition thereof), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and, with respect to any Investment made using the portion of the Cumulative Credit described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition thereof, the Total Leverage Ratio calculated on a Pro Forma Basis shall not in be greater than 5.6to 1.00;

**Cumulative Credit** shall mean, at any date, an amount, not less than zero in the aggregate, determined on a cumulative basis equal to, without duplication:

(a) the greater of (x) $XXX and (y) XX% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(b) the Cumulative Retained Excess Cash Flow Amount at such time; plus..

## (6) Basket for Investments in Similar Businesses:

substantively acts as another general investments basket

## (7) Basket for Investments in Joint Ventures:

substantively acts as another general investments basket, but limited to JVs (although the concept of JVs is not very limiting)

## (8) Basket for Investments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries:

disfavored by lenders because the borrower is transferring assets to an entity that it controls, but will not be restricted by the covenants of the debt documents

## (5) Unrestricted Subsidiaries

Credit agreements and indentures allow the borrower to designate one or more of its subsidiaries as not restricted by the covenants

### Examples include:
- A controlled joint venture that the minority equity holder does not want to be subject to the restrictions in the borrowers debt documents
- A newly acquired entity with existing debt that will remain outstanding but would breach the terms of the borrowers debt documents
- Incurring debt in escrow that will be used to finance an acquisition, but would only be permitted by the borrowers debt documents once the acquisition is consummated
- Transferring assets to a subsidiary for the purpose of distributing them to the borrowers equity holders
- Transferring assets to a subsidiary for the purpose of using the assets to secure debt incurred from third party creditors (as in J.Crew)

## (2) Conditions for Designation

- The designation of a restricted subsidiary as unrestricted is deemed to be an Investment in an amount equal to the fair market value of the equity in the subsidiary or intercompany loans made to the subsidiary
- The designation is subject to there being available capacity under the Investments covenant to make that investments in the unrestricted subsidiary
- The redesignation of any unrestricted subsidiary as restricted by the covenants is subject to there being available capacity under the debt and liens covenants for any debt of the subsidiary outstanding at the time that it is redesignated
- Both the designation and subsequent redesignation are often subject to additional conditions, such as absence of any event of default or a 2.0x fixed charge coverage ratio or a total net leverage ratio set at the leverage level on the closing date

## Additional Considerations for Non-US Companies

### Guarantees and collateral
- Difficulty in obtaining full and unconditional guarantees and/or fully enforceable security interests in all assets
- Potential inclusion of minimum guarantor coverage test

IFRS vs. GAAP accounting for investments

Different in what is considered market terms Limitation on Investments and Restricted Debt Payments 3

## 2) What is a Restricted Debt Payment?

Any prepayment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or discharge of certain specified indebtedness prior to its stated maturity

The scope of the covenant is one of the key business issues – What type of debt is permitted to be repaid ahead of the senior secured facilities or the bonds?

In a credit agreement, it could apply to any debt that is junior to the credit facilities in the capital structure, including junior lien secured debt, payment subordinated debt, or senior unsecured debt

In an indenture, since bonds are typically unsecured, the covenant usually only applies to payment subordinated debt

The scope may be further limited to exclude:
- Debt that is in an principal amount below a threshold amount, which may equal the threshold amount for the cross-default trigger
- Debt that matures within one year of the prepayment

## (1) The RDP Covenant in Credit Agreements

**Prepayments, Etc. of Indebtedness.**

In credit agreements, the limitation on making Restricted Debt Payments is frequently structured as a separate covenant that prohibits the making of RDPs or listed as a subsection to the RP covenant

In either case, it is followed by a litany of exceptions or dollar- or ratio- based baskets

## (2) Significant RDP Exceptions

Exception for debt that is prepaid with the proceeds of **permitted refinancing debt** (because the lenders are not worse off in such case) or prepayment by conversion into equity

### (1) Builder Basket

### (2) General RDP Basket:

this basket often includes a grower based on a percentage of EBITDA or total assets

### (3) Ratio Test for Unlimited Prepayments:

typically based on a total net leverage ratio set somewhere between the level for unlimited dividends and the level for unlimited investments

## (3) Limitation on Amendments to Junior Debt Documents

Purpose is to prevent the borrower from amending documents governing junior debt in a way that could circumvent other restrictions related to junior debt elsewhere in the credit agreement or that otherwise subverts the lenders expectations about the capital structure

- Lenders credit analysis of the borrower takes into account the borrowers closing date capital structure, including the maturity, interest rates and other terms and conditions of its other outstanding debt

- Changes to the terms of the other debt, such as to shorten the tenor, increase principal amortization, tighten covenants or increase interest rates, may adversely affect the borrowers credit profile or circumvent the limitations in the credit agreement

Covenant may broadly restrict any amendments that are materially adverse to the lenders under the senior credit facilities, or the covenant may specify which amendments are expressly prohibited

Applies to the same type of debt as the prepayment of junior debt covenant

This covenant is usually only in credit agreements but not in bond indentures

## The Investments and RDP Covenants in Indentures

In an indenture, the limitation on making Investments is subsumed within the Restricted Payments covenant, but the covenant carves out any **Permitted Investments**

Definition of Permitted Investments includes a litany of exceptions and dollar-and ratio- based baskets that specifically apply to investments

The Restricted Payments covenant includes a litany of exceptions and dollar-and ratio-based baskets that variously apply to dividends, RDPs and Restricted Investments

## Bond-Style RP Flexibility in Credit Agreements

Some top-tier sponsor form credit agreements also use this bond-style format
- However some sponsors prefer to keep the 3 separate covenants because the separate covenants provide opportunity for multiple baskets

Credit agreements also often include baskets that allow the borrower to **reallocate:**
- Unused capacity under certain RP baskets to be used to make Investments and RDPs
- Unused capacity under certain RDP baskets to be used to make Investments and (more rarely) RPs, and
- (Most rarely) unused capacity under certain Investments baskets to be used to make RPs and RDPs
- Sometimes there are baskets that allow the borrower to incur debt and (more controversially) liens up to the amount of unused capacity under certain RP baskets

## 3) Restricted Payments Overview

### What is a Restricted Payment?

### The Restricted Payments Covenant

### The Builder Basket

### Other Common RP Exceptions

### Other RP Considerations

## Background

There are 3 general types of Restricted Payments:
- **Payments to Equityholders**
- **Investments:** include acquisitions, equity investments and making of loans
- **Restricted Debt Payments (RDPs):** prepayments and redemptions of certain types of junior ranking debt (subordinated debt, junior lien debt (usually if there is a junior lien in the day-one structure) or, less commonly, unsecured debt)

Investments and RDPs are similar to equity RPs in that value is leaving the credit group, but unlike equity RPs the borrower is receiving something of value in return, so a creditor will prefer Investments and RDPs to equity RPs

Traditional credit agreements have separate covenants for these 3 types of Restricted Payments

High yield indentures and **high yield-style** credit agreements have one Restricted Payments covenant that covers all 3 types of actions

We will focus on **payments to equityholders** in this presentation and will refer to them as Restricted Payments or RPs

## 1) What is a Restricted Payment?

### Dividends and other distributions on account of equity interests
- Dividends on common stock
- Dividends on preferred stock
- Distributions such as spin-offs
- Includes private equity sponsors taking dividends for return on their investment or shareholders in a public company receiving regular dividends

### Repurchases and redemptions of equity interests (whether at the option of the issuer or the holder)
- Share repurchases have same impact to creditors as dividends

The covenant is structured as a general prohibition on declaring or making Restricted Payments, followed by a litany of exceptions (also referred to as **carveouts** (for unlimited exceptions) or **baskets** (capped exceptions))

### Scope
- Generally applies to borrower and restricted subsidiaries
- If financial ratios are calculated on a consolidated basis for Holdings, covenant should apply to Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries (including borrower)

## 2) Transactions Excluded from Scope

The following are not restricted (either excluded from the definition of Restricted Payments or permitted by the exceptions):
- Dividends or distributions by subsidiaries up the chain to the borrower or another restricted subsidiary
- Dividends or distributions by non-wholly owned subsidiaries to the other minority equityholders so long as the borrower or restricted subsidiaries receive at least a pro rata share
- Dividends payable solely in the form of qualified equity interests of the borrower (e.g., stock dividends)
  - Note that shares of subsidiaries are assets of the borrower so a distribution of shares of subsidiaries (i.e., spin-offs) **are** restricted

## 3) The Builder Basket #STUDY#

An important exception in the Restricted Payments covenant is the **Builder Basket**

In credit agreements, often called the **Cumulative Credit** or **Available Amount**

The Builder Basket is usually also permitted to be used for Investments and Restricted Debt Payments

The borrower may **grow** the Builder Basket over time based on:
- a specified financial performance metric +
- other transactions that are supposed to increase (or refresh) the borrowers equity cushion

If the borrower makes Restricted Payments using the Builder Basket, Builder Basket decreases and may be re-built later

> the Borrower may make Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Cumulative Credit immediately prior to the time of the making of such Restricted Payment

Usages of the Builder Basket

## (1) The Starter Component

The Builder Basket may start at $0, or at a specified starter level

The starter (if there is one) may be a flat number or the greater of (1) a flat number and (2) a financial metric that may change over time (the grower)
- Usually the amount of the financial metric at the original closing date approximates (or is less than) the flat number

**Cumulative Credit** shall mean, at any date, an amount, not less than zero in the aggregate, determined on a cumulative basis equal to, without duplication:

(a) the greater of (x) $30,000,00and (y) .5% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

**Cumulative Credit** shall mean, at any date, an amount, not less than zero in the aggregate, determined on a cumulative basis equal to, without duplication:

(a) the greater of (x) $30,000,00and (y) .5% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(b) the Cumulative Retained Excess Cash Flow Amount at such time; plus

## (2) The Financial Performance Builder Component

Financial performance builder prong is based on one of the following:

### Option A: 
50% of cumulative Consolidated Net Income (CNI), or if such cumulative CNI is a loss, 100% of such cumulative loss
- Most indentures use this formulation; some credit agreements that use the CNI formulation lack the 100% of loss part of the formulation

### Option B: 
Cumulative Retained Excess Cash Flow
- Retained Excess Cash Flow is the amount of Excess Cash Flow that is not required to prepay term loans under an Excess Cash Flow mandatory prepayment provision
- This is the traditional builder in credit agreements

### Option C: 
Cumulative EBITDA less [1.4]x cumulative Interest Expense
- This formulation is used generally only in credit agreements or indentures for technology, media or telecom companies
- The multiple of interest expense may be negotiated

The selected builder should be identified prior to launch of syndication
- Some aggressive sponsor transactions are based on the **greater of two or more of these prongs**
- In such case, each is tracked over time and the largest at each applicable time will be used

The cumulative CNI (Option A) and cumulative EBITDA minus interest expense (Option C) prongs are generally measured **from** either:
- the first day of the fiscal quarter in which the closing date occurs or
- the first day of the first full fiscal quarter after the closing date

**to** the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter for which financial statements are available

The Cumulative Retained ECF prong is generally measured for periods (generally fiscal years) for which Excess Cash Flow has been calculated
- Often calculated so that if ECF is negative for any particular year, the negative ECF is disregarded in the cumulative calculation

Companies with multiple tranches of debt often **back-date the start date for the builder** to the date the first tranche was originally incurred

### Example of back-dating the builder start date (for notes offering that closed on April 21, 2021):
> such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries since April , 2019 (the Reference Date) (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (), () and () of Section 4.08(b)), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

> (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) from and including January 1, 2019 to the end of the Issuers most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus

> (b) 100% of the aggregate Qualified Proceeds received by the Issuer subsequent to the Reference Date (i) as a contribution to its common equity capital ...

## (3) Additional Equity Component

- Proceeds from qualified equity issuances by the borrower or equity contributions received from the shareholders, excluding Equity Cures and equity contributions that are used to build other baskets

- Can include contributions of cash plus FMV of non-cash assets received

- Amount of any debt of the credit group that has been converted to qualified equity of the borrower

- Should count only proceeds received after the closing date (or whatever the base reference date is)

- Make sure that the closing date equity contributions do not increase the Builder Basket

> (c) (i) the cumulative amount of cash and Cash Equivalent proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of the Borrower or of any direct or indirect parent of the Borrower after the Closing Date and on or prior to such time (including upon exercise of warrants or options) which proceeds have been received in the form of common equity by, or contributed as common equity to the capital of, the Borrower and (ii) the principal amount of Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the Obligations or that is owed to an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary owed to a Person other than a Loan Party or a Restricted Subsidiary of a Loan Party incurred after the Closing Date that is converted to common Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Equity Interests) of the Borrower (or to Qualified Equity Interests of Holdings or of any direct or indirect parent of Holdings), in each case to the extent Not Otherwise Applied; plus

> (d) 100% of the aggregate amount of contributions to the common capital of the Borrower received in cash and Cash Equivalents after the Closing Date Not Otherwise Applied; plus Limitation on Restricted Payments 1

## (4) Returns on Investments Component

Returns on investments made using the primary RP builder prong, often capped at the amount of the original investment

Return on investments from Unrestricted Subsidiaries:
- dividends received from Unrestricted Subsidiaries
- proceeds from the sale of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries

FMV of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary if it is re-designated a Restricted Subsidiary Ideally each should be limited to amounts invested into the Unrestricted Subsidiary using the Builder Basket

> (c) to the extent not already included in Consolidated Net Income, 100% of the aggregate Qualified Proceeds from (A) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of any Restricted Investment that was made after the Reference Date and (B) repurchases, redemptions and repayments of such Restricted Investments and the receipt of any dividends or distributions from such Restricted Investments, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B) not to exceed the aggregate amount of such Restricted Investment that was previously treated as a Restricted Payment that reduced the Builder Basket; plus

> (d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer designated as such after the Reference Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the Reference Date, the Fair Market Value of the Issuers Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation (but only to the extent it was previously treated as a Restricted Payment that reduced the Builder Basket); plus

> (e) in the event that the Issuer and/or any Restricted Subsidiary makes any Investment in a Person that, as a result of or in connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to the existing Investment of the Issuer and/or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries in such Person to the extent it was previously treated as a Restricted Payment that reduced the Builder Basket.

## (5) Additional Components

### (1) Retained Asset Sale Proceeds:

means Net Proceeds from asset sales that are not subject to the asset sale mandatory prepayment provision.

### (2) Retailed Declined Proceeds:

means amount of prepayment of term loans from Net Proceeds of asset sales that was declined by lenders.
- In many credit agreements, amounts that were required to prepay loans from ECF or asset sale proceeds but are declined by lenders
  - This component would not be included in an indenture
- In some credit agreements and indentures, amounts that are not required to be swept under the asset sale sweep due to a leverage stepdown
  - This component is more common in credit agreements
- If there is a second lien term loan, such proceeds that do not repay the first lien but are used to prepay the second lien should not increase the Builder Basket in either the first lien or second lien credit agreement

## (6) Governors on Use

In indentures, usage of the Builder Basket is typically subject to the following **governors** (i.e., tests that must be satisfied in order to access the basket):
- Absence of a default or an event of default
- Meeting the ratio in the ratio debt exception (e.g., pro forma minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or maximum leverage ratio)

In credit agreements, usage of the starter or the performance prong of the Builder Basket may be subject to a governor
- This is a negotiated point, and in commitment papers, sometimes there is flex to add the governor if not included as an indicative term

## (7) Other Common RP Exceptions

### (1) Unlimited RP Ratio

Typically based on a leverage test (typically Total Net Leverage Ratio) set at a level significantly below the closing date level

### (2) General RP Basket

Often may be reallocated to be used to make Investments or Restricted Debt Payments
Often includes a grower based on a percentage of EBITDA or Total Assets

> (m) other Restricted Payments; provided that (x) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom and (y) immediately after giving effect to the making of such Restricted Payment, the Total Leverage Ratio calculated on a Pro Forma Basis shall not be greater than xxx to 1.0as of the last day of the most-recently ended Test Period;

> (n) additional Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $xxx and (y) x% of LTM EBITDA;

### (3) Repurchases of equity held by directors, officers and employees

Typically a dollar amount per year, which increases following an IPO
Typically unused amounts in any year may be carried forward to one or more subsequent years
Often basket is increased by:
- proceeds of equity issued to directors, officers and employees (such proceeds would not also increase the Builder Basket)
- proceeds of key person life insurance

> (4) a Restricted Payment to pay for the repurchase, redemptions, discharge, defeasance, retirement or other acquisition of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company held by any future, present or former officer, director, employee, manager, consultant or independent contractor (or their respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Company upon death, disability, retirement or termination of employment of such Person or otherwise pursuant to any management equity plan or equity option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement, any severance agreement or any stock subscription or equityholder agreement; provided, however, that the aggregate Restricted Payments made under this clause (4) in any calendar year do not exceed at the time made the greater of (x) $xxx and (y) xx multiplied by Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period (or the greater of (x) $xxx and (y) xx multiplied by Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period following an initial public offering described in clause (8) below) (with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to succeeding calendar years);

### (4) Post-IPO RP Basket

For an issuer that is private at the time of the offering, a basket available after a Qualifying IPO permitting an amount of RPs **per year** equal to a percentage of IPO proceeds (typically 6%)
In some cases the basket is based on a percentage (again, typically 6%) of market capitalization of the Company
Formulation may also be structured as greater of or sum of the two prongs

> (8) following consummation of the first public offering of the Companys common equity or the common equity of any Parent Entity of the Company after the Issue Date, Restricted Payments to equityholders of the Company (or a Restricted Payment to any such Parent Entity to fund the payment by such Parent Entity of Restricted Payments to its equityholders), in an aggregate amount per annum not to exceed the sum of (a) 6.0% of Market Capitalization and (b) 6.0% of the net proceeds of any offering of Equity Interests of the Company or a Parent Entity of the Company that is contributed to the Company after the Issue Date;

### (5) Overhead expenses / tax distributions

Permits dividends in an amount necessary to cover certain expenses of the parent company as well as, for LLCs and other pass-through entities, the taxes of the equityholders
Should be narrowly limited to amounts attributable to the ownership of the company
Tax amounts in particular can potentially be very large and should be reviewed carefully

> () the declaration and payment of dividends or distributions by the Company to, or the making of loans to, any Parent Entity of the Company in amounts required for any Parent Entity of the Company to pay or cause to be paid, in each case without duplication, ...

> (b) foreign, federal, state and local income and similar taxes (including any interest or penalties related thereto), to the extent such income or similar taxes are attributable to the income, revenue, receipts, capital or margin of the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and, to the extent of the amount actually received from its Unrestricted Subsidiaries, in amounts required to pay such taxes to the extent attributable to the income of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries; provided that in each case the amount of such payments in any fiscal year does not exceed the amount that the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and, to the extent described above, its Unrestricted Subsidiaries would be required to pay in respect of foreign, federal, state and local taxes for such fiscal year were the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and, to the extent described above, its Unrestricted Subsidiaries to pay such taxes separately from any such Parent Entity; ...

> (d) general operating (including, without limitation, expenses related to the maintenance of organizational existence and auditing or other accounting matters) and overhead costs and expenses of any Parent Entity of the Company to the extent such costs and expenses are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Companys proportionate share of such amount relating to such Parent Entity being a public company;

## 4) Other RP Considerations

Most material RP baskets should be subject to no Event of Default existing at the time of the RP or resulting from the RP (an EoD **blocker**)
- In aggressive deals this has been watered down and sometimes limited to no payment or bankruptcy Event of Default or sometimes no blocker at all

RP baskets may be tested at the time a dividend or distribution is declared per Limited Condition Transaction provisions, rather than at the time the payment is actually made

In some deals, the company may later reclassify an RP from one basket to another
- For example, an RP that previously was made under a dollar basket can later be moved to the ratio basket, which frees up the dollar basket for future use

### Example:

> For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments described in the preceding clauses (1) through (33) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of Permitted Investments, or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant the Company will be entitled to divide or classify (or later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1) through (33) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of Permitted Investments, in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant and (B) in the event that a portion of any Restricted Payment could be classified as having been made pursuant to clause (24) above (giving pro forma effect to the making of such Restricted Payment), the Company, in its sole discretion, may classify such portion of such Restricted Payments as having been made pursuant to such clause (24) above and thereafter the remainder of such Restricted Payment or as having been made pursuant to one or more of the other clauses above; provided that if the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio test for the incurrence of any such Restricted Payment would be satisfied on a pro forma basis as of the end of any subsequent fiscal quarter after such incurrence, the reclassification described in this paragraph shall be deemed to have occurred automatically.

Certain RP baskets may instead be used to make Investments or Restricted Debt Payments
- In general, creditors are better off if a company makes an Investment or Restricted Debt Payment rather than an RP
- However, baskets for Investments or Restricted Debt Payments should not be available for RPs

In some aggressive deals, certain RP baskets may also be used to incur debt, rather than paying an RP, including sometimes secured debt
- In some deals they actually can incur $2 of debt for every $1 of RP capacity

If this construct is included in commitment papers, typically there is flex to remove the ability to use RP capacity to incur secured debt

> (uu)Additional Investments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the portion, if any, of the Restricted Payment Amount, on the relevant date of determination that the U.S. Borrower elects to apply pursuant to this clause (uu);

> 10.1 Limitation on Indebtedness. 
> The U.S. Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur, contingently or otherwise, with respect to any Indebtedness, except...

> (w) unsecured Indebtedness in the amount equal to the Available RP Capacity Amount;

> **Available RP Capacity Amount** shall mean the amount of Restricted Payments that may be made at the time of determination pursuant to Sections 10.6 (b), (f), (s) and (v) minus the sum of the amount of the Available RP Capacity Amount utilized by the U.S. Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to (A) make Restricted Payments in reliance on Sections 10.6 (b), (0, (s) and (v) and (B) incur Indebtedness pursuant to Section 10.1(w) utilizing the Available RP Capacity Amount.

## 3) Asset Sales Overview

### Structure of Asset Sale Provisions

### Dispositions Covenant in Credit Agreements

### Unlimited Dispositions Exception

### Asset Sale Mandatory Prepayment Provision in Credit Agreements

### Asset Sale Offer to Purchase in Indentures

### J. Crew Protection

## Background

Creditors care about dispositions of assets outside of ordinary course of business because:

- in the case of a disposition of collateral to third parties, the liens on the assets are automatically released

- assets represent future cash flows, and their disposition may result in a reduction of cash flow generating capacity

- dispositions may change business and risk profile of the company (affecting **EBITDA,** nature of operations, etc.)

This presentation will discuss the most significant provisions in leveraged cash flow credit agreements and high yield indentures that apply to asset sales

Note that investment grade credit agreements and indentures do not have asset sale provisions, and asset sale provisions asset-based credit agreements differ from those described herein

## Credit Agreements vs. Indentures

**Credit agreements** include the following provisions:

- Limitation on asset dispositions covenant: Prohibits asset dispositions other than those permitted

- Asset sale mandatory prepayment: Requires that proceeds of certain asset dispositions be applied to prepay loans

**Indentures** require the issuer to reinvest proceeds or make an **offer to purchase notes** with asset sale proceeds

- This provision also includes the requirement for a specified portion of the consideration to be received in cash (or other consideration that is treated like cash)

## 1) Limitation on Dispositions Covenant in Credit Agreements

### (1) What is a Disposition?

**Disposition** or **Dispose** means the sale, transfer, license, lease or other disposition (in one transaction or in a series of transactions and whether effected pursuant to a division or otherwise) of any property by any Person (including any sale and leaseback transaction and any issuance of Equity Interests by a Subsidiary of such Person), including any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposal, with or without recourse, of any notes or accounts receivable or any rights and claims associated therewith.

Also called Asset Sale or Asset Disposition

Definition of Dispositions is fairly broad and includes:
- sales and other transfers of assets
- leases and intellectual property licenses
- issuances of equity interests in subsidiaries to third parties
- transfers of assets in connection with Delaware LLC divisions and similar transactions

Like other negative covenants in the credit agreement, the dispositions covenant is structured as a general prohibition on dispositions, followed by a litany of exceptions

### Example: Limitation on Dispositions Covenant
> Section 6.04. Dispositions of Assets. 
> Holdings and each other Loan Party shall not, nor shall it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Disposition of all or any part of its property or assets, except...

### (2) Scope

Generally applies to borrower and restricted subsidiaries

If financial ratios are calculated on a consolidated basis for Holdings and the restricted payments covenant applies to Holdings, the covenant and the exceptions should apply to Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries (including borrower)

### (3) Exceptions in the Dispositions Covenant

The following are customary exceptions in the dispositions covenant:

#### (1) Ordinary course of business exceptions

- Dispositions of inventory and goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business
- Licenses and leases not materially interfering with the conduct of the business and terminations thereof
- Dispositions of (i) outdated, obsolete, surplus or worn-out property and (ii) property no longer used or useful in the conduct of the business

#### (2) Intragroup dispositions

Dispositions between or among the borrower and one or more restricted subsidiaries are permitted without limit 
- If the credit agreement restricts investments in non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries, consider whether dispositions to such restricted subsidiaries should be subject to additional restrictions (such as any disposition for less than fair market value being deemed to be an investment to the extent of the difference), although this would be uncommon
- Watch out for language that would permit unlimited dispositions to unrestricted subsidiaries or to Holdings (unless Holdings is subject to the covenants)

Other notable carve-outs:
- Immaterial assets with dollar limit per transaction or series of related transactions
- Sale-leaseback transactions
- General dispositions basket: may be styled as a cap on dispositions in any fiscal year or over the life of the loan
- Exchange of assets for other assets useful for the borrowers business
  - Note that the asset swap basket is often unlimited in indentures
- Any investments and restricted payments otherwise permitted under the credit agreement
- Any sales of receivables in connection with Qualified Securitization Transactions
- Dispositions as a result of, or in connection with, foreclosure on, or condemnation of, or exercise of the eminent domain power with respect to, assets

#### (3) [Unlimited] Dispositions Exception [75% Cash Consideration Basket]

> Dispositions for fair market value; provided that with respect to any single Disposition transaction or a series of related transactions with respect to assets having Disposition Consideration in excess of the greater of $XXX and XX% of Consolidated EBITDA as of the last day of the most recently ended Test Period, at least 75% of the consideration for such Disposition, shall consist of Cash or Cash Equivalents...

Customary in sponsor credit agreements; may be capped in middle-market deals (either per year or over the life of the deal)

Permits any disposition that meets the specified requirements:
- Borrower must receive fair market value consideration
- At least 75% of consideration must be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents
- May be subject to a **de minimis** threshold below which the cash consideration requirement does not apply
- The cash requirement works together with the mandatory prepayment provision since the borrower needs cash to prepay loans
- Net cash proceeds of such dispositions are to be applied as required under the mandatory prepayment section

Certain non-cash consideration is deemed to be cash and will count toward the 75% cash consideration requirement:
i. any non-subordinated Indebtedness or other liabilities that are assumed by the transferee
ii. any obligations that are converted into cash within [180] days following the closing of the applicable asset sale
iii. Designated Non-cash Consideration in an aggregate amount at any time outstanding not to exceed a specified threshold (this basket refreshes when the non-cash consideration is converted to cash)

In some aggressive deals, the cash requirement is determined on an aggregate basis for all sales

> ... for purposes of this clause, the following shall be deemed to be cash: (A) any liabilities ... of Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Obligations) that are assumed by the transferee with respect to the applicable disposition and for which Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall have been validly released by all applicable creditors in writing, (B) any securities, notes, other obligations or assets received by Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are convertible into cash or Cash Equivalents within 18days following the closing of the applicable asset sale, (C) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary that is not Subordinated Indebtedness received from such transferee, and (D) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in such asset sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (y) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $XXX and XX% of Consolidated EBITDA of Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended Test Period (measured at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration) (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value)...

## 2) Asset Sale Mandatory Prepayments [Asset Sale Sweeps] [CAs]

### (1) Asset Sale Mandatory Prepayment

Also called asset sale sweep

Borrower is required to make a mandatory prepayment of term loans with net cash proceeds from specified dispositions
- Typically only dispositions under the unlimited dispositions exception or sometimes certain other specified baskets (for instance, sale-leaseback basket) trigger this provision

Exclusion from provision for **de minimis** transactions
- Prepayment is required if aggregate amount of net cash proceeds per transaction or during a fiscal year exceeds a threshold
- Check that there isnt a double **de minimis** exclusion (in the definition of disposition or elsewhere)

> Within 1days following each date on or after the Closing Date upon which Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives any Net Cash Proceeds from any Prepayment Asset Sale, an amount equal to the Applicable Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of the Net Cash Proceeds therefrom shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the requirements hereof; provided, however, with respect to an aggregate amount of no more than the greater of $XXX and XX% of Consolidated EBITDA of Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended Test Period, of such Net Cash Proceeds received by Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries in any fiscal year of Borrower, such Net Cash Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied or used to make mandatory repayments of Term Loans [and any required prepayment shall be only the amount in excess thereof]

Traditional credit agreements require the borrower to apply 100% of net cash proceeds to prepay the term loans

However, some credit agreements (particularly sponsor deals) include **step-downs to 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% depending on a leverage ratio**
- The portion not required to be swept (e.g., 25% of the net cash proceeds if the sweep percentage is 75%) is added to the Builder Basket, which is available for restricted payments, restricted debt payments and investments

> **Applicable Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage** shall mean, at any time, 100%; provided that, if, within five Business Days (or within such later period as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion) of the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds from the relevant Prepayment Asset Sale, Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying that on a Pro Forma Basis immediately after giving effect to such Prepayment Asset Sale and the application of the proceeds thereof, the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is (i) less than or equal to X.XX:1.0but greater than X.XX:1.00, the Applicable Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage shall instead be 25% and (ii) less than or equal to X.XX:1.00, the Applicable Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage shall instead be 0%.

Because of this effect on the Builder Basket, combined with the various exceptions to the sweep (such as the reinvestment capacity), an asset sale sweep with leveraged-based stepdowns may permit significant leakage from the credit without actually providing any benefit to the lenders

> **Cumulative Credit** shall mean, at any date, an amount, not less than zero in the aggregate, determined on a cumulative basis equal to, without duplication:...

> ( ) the aggregate amount of Retained Declined Proceeds and Retained Asset Sale Proceeds retained by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent not otherwise applied to prepay the Second Lien Term Loans; ...

**Restricted Payments Covenant**

> (h) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, the Borrower may make Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Cumulative Credit immediately prior to the time of the making of such Restricted Payment; provided that solely to the extent Retained Asset Sale Proceeds are being used to fund Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (h), the Total Leverage Ratio (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Restricted Payment) is less than or equal to XXX to 1.00;

Net Cash Proceeds are defined as gross sale proceeds in the form of cash or cash equivalents, **minus**:
- transaction costs and expenses
- taxes payable in connection with the respective asset sale
- prepayments of **indebtedness or other obligations which are secured by the sold assets by a prior lien**
- amounts in escrow and amounts of reserves for indemnity obligations (until they are released)

> **Net Cash Proceeds** shall mean, with respect to a Prepayment Asset Sale, an amount in cash equal to the gross cash proceeds (including any cash received by way of deferred payment..., but only as and when received) received from such Prepayment Asset Sale, net of (i) costs of, and expenses associated with, such Prepayment Asset Sale (including fees and commissions), (ii) any taxes paid or payable as a result of such Prepayment Asset Sale (including Borrowers good faith estimate of any incremental income taxes that will be payable as a result of such Prepayment Asset Sale, including pursuant to tax sharing arrangements or any tax distributions), (iii) payments of unassumed liabilities relating to the assets sold and required payments of any Indebtedness or other obligations (other than the Loans and Indebtedness secured on a pari passu or junior basis to the Loans) which are secured by the assets which were sold or would be in default under the terms thereof as a result of such Prepayment Asset Sale, (iv) amounts provided as a reserve in accordance with U.S. GAAP against any liabilities under any indemnification obligation or purchase price adjustment associated with such Prepayment Asset Sale (provided that to the extent and at the time any such amounts are released from such reserve to Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, such amounts shall constitute Net Cash Proceeds) and (v) cash escrows from the sale price for such Prepayment Asset Sale (provided that to the extent and at the time any such amounts are released from escrow to Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, such amounts shall constitute Net Cash Proceeds).

Asset sale step-downs are an important business point, which is often modified during marketing due to market focus (and, in commitment papers, there is almost always flex to increase the percentage to the traditional 100%)

### (2) Reinvestment Right

Instead of making a prepayment, the borrower is allowed to reinvest net cash proceeds to purchase assets useful for the business
- Tighter credit agreements require investment to be in fixed (or capital) assets (not inventory or other current assets)
- Sometimes net cash proceeds are defined after deducting for reinvested proceeds

Borrower is given [~18] months to reinvest net cash proceeds
- If such net cash proceeds are committed to be reinvested within such period, the reinvestment period is often extended by an additional [6] months to consummate the reinvestment transaction Asset Sale Provisions 2

#### Example:

> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds that would otherwise be required to be applied as a mandatory repayment hereunder to reinvest in the purchase of assets useful in the business of Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries within months following the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if within such -month period, Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within 18days following such -month period during which Borrower so committed to such plan of reinvestment)...

**Q: Should funding operating expenses be a permitted reinvestment use of asset sale proceeds?**

**A:** No, paying operating expenses does not rebuild cash flow generating capacity. Make sure language is not vague enough to permit the borrower to use the proceeds to fund operating expenses (as in reinvest in the business).

### (3) Application of Payments

Borrower may have outstanding (or may have flexibility to incur) tranches of **pari passu** secured debt incurred under the same credit agreement or separate instruments, which may contain similar mandatory prepayment or offer to purchase provisions

The amount that would be subject to mandatory prepayment may be permitted to be shared (or offered) among holders of all **pari passu** secured debt on a pro rata basis

Borrowers counsel may request pro rata sharing of proceeds with second lien and other indebtedness but this is not customary

#### Example:

> Each amount [of mandatory prepayment] shall be applied to repay the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans, with each Tranche of then outstanding Term Loans to be allocated its Term Loan Percentage of each amount so required to be applied; provided that to the extent any Permitted Pari Passu Notes, any Permitted Pari Passu Loans, Refinancing Notes/Loans or Secured Notes (or, in each case, any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any of the foregoing that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Obligations) requires any mandatory prepayment or repurchase of pari passu Indebtedness from any Net Sale Proceeds that would otherwise be required to be applied to prepay Term Loans, up to a pro rata portion (based on the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans and such pari passu secured Indebtedness then outstanding) of such Net Sale Proceeds that would otherwise be required to prepay Term Loans may be applied to prepay or repurchase such pari passu secured Indebtedness in lieu of prepaying Term Loans as provided above...

### (4) Declined Proceeds

Lenders commonly have an option to reject the amount of mandatory prepayment or a part thereof
- Lenders may prefer to keep the loan outstanding especially if there is a prepayment premium for optional prepayments
- If draft credit agreement does not provide for such option, add it to the issues list to discuss with the banks

Prepayments rejected by the lenders constitute **Declined Proceeds**
- If there is a second lien credit agreement, the borrower typically is required to offer to prepay the second lien term loans

Any amounts remaining thereafter are commonly added to the Builder Basket, which is available for restricted payments, restricted debt payments and investments

> Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any mandatory repayment of Term Loans required to be made hereunder at least three Business Days prior to the date of such repayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such repayment and provide the amount of such repayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of the contents of Borrowers Notice of Loan Prepayment and of such Lenders pro rata share of any repayment. Each Lender may reject all or a portion of its pro rata share of any mandatory repayment (such declined amounts, the **Declined Proceeds**) of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.02 by providing written notice...

## 3) Asset Sale Offer To Purchase Requirement In Indentures

### A. Definition of Asset Sale

- Includes a litany of exceptions, similar to the exceptions in the dispositions covenant in a credit agreement
- The asset sale offer provisions apply only to transactions that are not covered by the exceptions in the definition of asset sale

Issuer may not consummate an asset sale unless:
- it receives fair market consideration at the time of the asset sale
- at least **75% of the consideration is in the form of cash and cash equivalents** (similar non-cash items as in credit agreements count toward the cash consideration requirement)
- net cash proceeds are used to:
  - reinvest
  - prepay certain other debt
  - make an offer to purchase the notes at par

### (2) Reinvestment

Issuer is permitted to use proceeds to reinvest
- Similar issues as in the credit agreement on the types of assets in which the issuer is permitted to reinvest
- Bond investors generally consider acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in other fixed assets as credit-positive

Reinvestment period is generally longer than in credit agreements, often [18] months or longer (plus additional [6] months in the case investment is committed within the initial period)
- If the company has secured bonds and unsecured bonds, the unsecured bonds will have a longer period, to permit the potential application of proceeds toward secured bonds first

### Asset Sale Provisions

### (3) Prepayment of Other Debt

Issuer has right to prepay certain other debt before making an offer to purchase notes
- If the bonds are unsecured: any secured debt
- If the bonds are second lien bonds: any first lien secured debt
- If the bonds are first lien bonds: typically limited to just the first lien credit agreement
- Any debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries (because such debt is structurally senior to the notes anyway)

If any revolving indebtedness is prepaid, traditionally the revolving commitments must be reduced by amount of prepayment

Any amounts remaining after reinvestment and debt prepayments are called **Excess Proceeds**

### (4) Asset Sale Offer to Purchase

If amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds a certain threshold (typically cumulatively, but could be calculated on an annual basis), the issuer must make an offer to purchase notes
- If the **de minimis** threshold is exceeded, the entire amount (i.e., 100%) of Excess Proceeds is required to be applied to repurchase the notes

The purchase price in the offer is at **100% of the aggregate principal amount of notes** (up to the Excess Proceeds) plus accrued interest
- Issuer may offer to purchase other pari passu indebtedness on a pro rata basis (allows additional tranches of notes issued under different indentures to have similar asset sale provisions)

> Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.(b) hereof shall constitute **Excess Proceeds.** When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds in any calendar year exceeds the greater of $XXX million or XX% of Consolidated Total Assets, the Company shall make an offer (an **Asset Sale Offer**) to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer shall be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase, and shall be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer **(Declined Asset Sale Proceeds),** the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture.

The standard indenture provisions require 100% of the Excess Proceeds (once a specified threshold is met) to be applied to the offer to purchase

A few aggressive sponsor bond deals include a step-down of the sweep percentage based on a leverage ratio, with the unswept portion increasing the Builder Basket
- This step-down concept is very unusual in bonds and should be flagged if included

Surprisingly the bond market has fended off degradation of its covenants more successfully than the syndicated TLB market

> Any Applicable Proceeds that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any such proceeds not required to be applied or invested as a result of the fourth paragraph of this covenant) will constitute Excess Proceeds...

> **Applicable Proceeds** means the Applicable Percentage of the Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale.

> **Applicable Percentage** means 100.0%; provided, however, that the Applicable Percentage shall be (i) 25% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 5.10:1.0but greater than 4.60:1.00, and (ii) 0% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 4.60:1.00.

### Asset Sale Offers to Purchase

**Q: How many asset sale offers to purchase are typically conducted per year?**

**A: None!**

## 4) J. Crew Protection in Credit Agreements

> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.04, Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not, directly or indirectly, sell or otherwise transfer any Intellectual Property that is material to the operations of Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

J. Crew used available negative covenant capacity to transfer intellectual property material to the loan parties to an unrestricted subsidiary and incurred additional debt secured by such intellectual property

J. Crew protection (if included) includes, among other things, an overriding provision in the dispositions covenant restricting dispositions of intellectual property material to the loan parties to unrestricted subsidiaries

J. Crew protection also includes a similar restriction in the investment covenant and restricts the designation of subsidiaries holding intellectual property material to the loan parties as unrestricted subsidiaries

## 4) Excluded Assets, Collateral Release Provisions and Other Selected Collateral-Related Issues Overview

### Excluded Assets

### Perfection Limitations

### Guarantee and Collateral Release Provisions

### Creation

Debtor grants a security interest in collateral to the secured party
- The concept of Excluded Assets (discussed in the first segment of this program) relates to creation (or rather, non-creation) of security interests

### Perfection

Alerts future creditors that there is a security interest against the debtors assets that are pledged
- Well discuss limitations on perfection requirements in the second segment of this program

### Priority

Determines which secured creditor has priority over the collateral if more than one secured creditor has perfected its security interest

The method or timing of perfection will determine priority for security interests in different types of assets

## All Assets?

We colloquially speak of most secured transactions we work on as all assets collateral financings

In reality however, granting security interests in literally all assets may be difficult, expensive and/or impractical, depending on the type of assets the borrower* and the other loan parties have

Many borrowers negotiate exclusions from the collateral package or exceptions from the perfection requirements to reduce the costs and burden of granting or perfecting liens on certain types of assets

Depending on how the limitation on liens covenant may be drafted, these exclusions may also preserve the borrowers flexibility to grant liens to other creditors

We therefore try to make these exclusions as narrow as possible 
*In this presentation we will refer to the obligor as the borrower, but the discussion applies equally to an issuer of secured notes

## Presentation Approach

We will discuss these topics using examples from term sheets (i.e., term sheets attached to commitment letters or marketing term sheets used in uncommitted financings)

The excerpted language in this presentation shows the changes we would recommend be made to the term sheet, as this is where the concepts are typically negotiated first (although sometimes a grid sets forth abbreviated versions of these concepts)

If you are working on a commitment letter that defers to the precedent documentation for one or more of these concepts, you should review the precedent documentation to see how they address these concepts

Consider whether there are differences in the precedent transaction and the transaction you are working on that warrant a change in how these concepts are addressed in the precedent documentation (e.g., if the borrower has substantial foreign operations)
- We may have limited flexibility to negotiate what is in the precedent documentation, but significant issues should be flagged to the client

## EXCLUDED ASSETS

### Excluded Assets Generally

Secured financing documents typically use the term Excluded Assets (or Excluded Collateral or Excluded Property) to refer to assets that are not part of the collateral, or may set forth a list of exclusions from the collateral package even if a defined term is not used

In the definitive financing documents, Excluded Assets may be defined in the credit agreement, the indenture or the security agreement

### Real Property

Whether **real estate** is wholly excluded may be covered in the grid; if not, confirm with the client as it is a business issue

In recent years, some banks have moved away from real property collateral due to regulatory requirements in obtaining and maintaining real property collateral (e.g., appraisal requirement under FIRREA, environmental due diligence, flood insurance)

Traditional approach is to have a threshold for excluding immaterial real property

### Leasehold Interests

**Leasehold interests:** In order to grant a security interest in a real property leasehold interest, a mortgage is required (same as real property fee interest)

Exclusion for leasehold interests should be limited to real property leasehold interests
- Security interests in other personal property leasehold interests are perfected by filing a UCC

> Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Collateral include:
> (a) any [fee-owned real property] or any real property leasehold interests

### Vehicles and Other Assets Subject to Certificates of Title

This exclusion should be added only if motor vehicles are not a material portion of the loan parties assets

Note that a UCC-1 filing perfects security interests in motor vehicles **if the vehicles constitute inventory held for sale or lease** by a person or leased by that person as lessor and that person is in the business of selling motor vehicles (UCC 9-311(d))

If vehicles are included in the **borrowing base in an ABL transaction,** then they should not be excluded from the collateral to the extent they are included in the borrowing base

Note that this exclusion applies only to those assets subject to a certificate of title statute (includes cranes, forklifts and trailers)

Airplanes, aircrafts, rail cars, locomotives, boats or barges are not subject to certificate of title statutes

Security interests in such assets are perfected by non-UCC methods

> (f) motor vehicles and other goods subject to certificates of title (to the extent a security interest therein cannot be perfected by a UCC-1 filing)

### Trademark Intent-to-Use Applications

All patent and copyright applications are typically part of the collateral package

> (h) any application for registration of a trademark filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) on an intent-to-use basis until such time (if any) as a statement of use or amendment to allege use is accepted by the PTO, at which time such trademark shall automatically become part of the Collateral and subject to the security interest pledged

All trademark applications based on actual use of the trademark are also typically part of the collateral package

However, **trademark applications based on intent to use** (ITU) are typically excluded until a statement of use or amendment to allege use is accepted by the PTO

Under the Lanham Act, assignments of such ITU applications will invalidate the ITU application. While the grant of a security interest is not intended to be an assignment, a security interest can be re-characterized as an assignment. See **The Clorox Company v. Chemical Bank,** U.S.P.Q. (TTAB 1996).

### Letter-of-Credit Rights

Letter-of-credit rights are rights in a letter of credit held by the beneficiary of a letter of credit

Note that it is not common for the loan parties in our transactions to be beneficiaries of letters of credit

> (j) letter-of-credit rights

Letter-of-credit rights can be perfected only by control unless they constitute supporting obligations

As a result, the collateral agent typically does not get control of letter-of-credit rights
- Supporting obligations for collateral are perfected automatically upon perfecting the security interest in that collateral

> (unless constituting supporting obligations for other Collateral)

**PARTIES INVOLVED IN ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF CREDIT**
- Account Party requests letter of credit → issues letter of credit → Beneficiary (Landlord, governmental authority, business counterparty, etc.)
- The rights of the beneficiary under the letter of credit are letter-of-credit rights

### Commercial Tort Claims

A **commercial tort claim** is a **potential right by a loan party to recovery from a third party** for damages suffered by such loan party

> (k) commercial tort claims with a value less than [an amount to be set forth in the Loan Documentation] / [$ ]

It is not typical for all commercial tort claims to be excluded from the collateral package; a threshold is usually agreed to

Under the UCC, most collateral can be sufficiently described in the security agreement by using UCC defined types of collateral (e.g., inventory, equipment, general intangibles). That is not the case with commercial tort claims and certain other types of collateral. Merely describing the collateral as all commercial tort claims (as defined in the UCC) in the security agreement is inadequate so a more descriptive description is required.

The financing documentation should require that commercial tort claims existing on the closing date **be described in a schedule to the Perfection Certificate or the security agreement,** and such schedule be updated from time to time when a commercial tort claim exceeding the applicable threshold arises

**Q: True or False: It is reasonable to exclude deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodity accounts from the collateral in non-ABL deals since control agreements are burdensome.**

**A: False.** The agent could have perfected security interests in such accounts without control agreements so they should not be excluded from the collateral. Whether control agreements are required should be addressed in the perfection provisions.

### Deposit Accounts, Securities Accounts and Commodity Accounts

Company counsel may seek to exclude all deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodity accounts from the collateral; however, there is no practical or legal reason for such blanket exclusion

The collateral agent would have a perfected security interest in **securities accounts** and **commodity accounts** by (i) the UCC-1 filing or (ii) being a securities intermediary or broker (i.e., if the account is with the institution that is the collateral agent)

The collateral agent would have a security interest in **deposit accounts** (i) if the deposit account is with the institution that is the collateral agent or (ii) to the extent the funds in the deposit account consist of proceeds of collateral, (a) so long as it is identifiable or (b) for 2days after becoming proceeds

Ideally, delete this exclusion and refer them to the exceptions from the perfection requirements (no control agreements to be required) limit this exclusion to specific excluded accounts, for the benefit of third parties that are not loan parties

If this is not accepted, limit exclusion to specific excluded accounts for the benefit of third parties that are not loan parties

At a minimum, the collateral agent should have a security interest in all proceeds of other collateral that is contained in the accounts

> (n) ~~all deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodity accounts~~ segregated trust fund accounts, sales tax or similar accounts, payroll accounts and escrow accounts for the benefit of unaffiliated third parties
> (n) all deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodity accounts, other than to the extent they contain any proceeds of other Collateral

### Assets Located Outside the US

US loan parties assets located outside the US should not be excluded from the collateral

In bankruptcy, lenders may be able to claim security interests in such assets by virtue of UCC filings, even though such security interests may not be enforceable in a foreign jurisdiction

All that the borrower should be concerned with is that no actions are required outside of the US to perfect in foreign collateral (which should be addressed in the perfection provisions)

### Equity in CFCs and FSHCOs

**CFC** means controlled foreign corporation under Section 956 of the US Internal Revenue Code

If the borrower is a non-US company, its subsidiaries (except those under the chain of a US subsidiary) are not CFCs

**FSHCO** (foreign subsidiary holding company) means any direct or indirect subsidiary incorporated or organized in the US or any State or territory thereof that owns no material assets (directly or through one or more disregarded entities) other than the equity interests of one or more subsidiaries that are CFCs

Subject to certain exceptions, a pledge in excess of 2/3 of the outstanding voting equity of a subsidiary that is a CFC or a FSHCO is considered a guarantee by that subsidiary for purposes of Section 956 of the US Internal Revenue Code

A guarantee by a controlled foreign corporation could result in a deemed dividend of earnings by that CFC, subject to certain exceptions

We typically limit pledge of the voting equity of CFCs and FSHCOs to 65% of the outstanding voting equity

If there are any non-US loan parties, the pledge of its equity should not be limited (100% of its equity could be pledged without incremental tax consequences since it is already a guarantor)

> (d) the ~~voting~~ capital stock of any (i) FSHCO or (ii) first tier material foreign subsidiary that is a CFC, in each case, in excess of 65% of the outstanding voting stock thereof

### Margin Stock

**Margin stock** includes any equity security registered or having unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange

> (m) margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U)

If margin stock is pledged as collateral, bank and non-bank lenders must comply with certain requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

As a result of these regulatory requirements (although they are not particularly burdensome), margin stock is often excluded from the collateral package if inclusion of such margin stock as collateral is unintended# Part 4 - Collateral and Security Agreements

If the borrower owns a substantial interest in a public company at closing, discuss with the client whether the equity interests should be collateral, and if so, the lenders should be alerted to the Federal Reserve requirements

## Equity Interests in Unrestricted and Immaterial Subsidiaries

Whether stock of **unrestricted** or **immaterial subsidiaries** is excluded is a business point

> (o) capital stock of unrestricted subsidiaries and immaterial subsidiaries
> to the extent a security interest therein cannot be perfected by a UCC-1 filing

Lenders that are focused on **leakage** would want to remove this exclusion

The pledge in stock would be perfected by the UCC-1 filing that we would file in any event

Unrestricted subsidiaries may obtain their own financing, and the lenders to the unrestricted subsidiary may seek a pledge of the stock of the unrestricted subsidiary, so excluding them from the collateral package may facilitate financing at unrestricted subsidiaries

An alternative to excluding them from the collateral package is to exclude them from the requirement for delivery of possessory collateral

## Equity Interests in Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries

> (i) equity interests in any person other than wholly owned subsidiaries to the extent the pledge thereof is prohibited by charter documents or joint venture or shareholders agreements after giving effect to the applicable anti-non-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law

In some deals the company proposes to exclude all equity of persons that are not wholly owned subsidiaries even if there are no limitations on the pledging of such equity by its owners

This should be raised as a business issue; lenders that are focused on **leakage** would want to remove this exclusion

From the lenders perspective, stock in non-wholly owned persons should be excluded only if the pledge thereof is not permitted by the joint-venture or other organizational documents governing such subsidiary, and the exclusion **should be subject to a UCC override** (highlighted here)

## What is the UCC Override?

UCC Sections 9-406(d) and 9-408(a) provide that anti-assignment provisions in certain contracts and instruments are ineffective (the UCC overrides such anti-assignment provisions)

**UCC Section 9-406(d)** generally covers **payment streams:**

Subject to certain exceptions, a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent such term **prohibits or restricts the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in an account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note** (or to the extent the security interest may give rise to a breach or termination of the underlying agreement or note)

**UCC Section 9-408(a)** generally covers **intangible rights:**

Subject to certain exceptions, a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor is ineffective to the extent such term would impair the **creation, attachment or perfection of a security interest in a promissory note, health care insurance receivable, or general intangible** (or to the extent the security interest may give rise to a breach or termination of the underlying note, receivable or general intangible)

The override provisions **do not apply to inventory, equipment and corporate stock** (and other equity in certain jurisdictions)

## Interests in Contracts, Permits, Licenses and Government Authorizations

If the company has contracts, permits and licenses that provide that they cannot be assigned, the UCC **will override such anti-assignment provisions** and the secured parties could still claim a security interest in such contracts and proceeds of such contracts

This exception allows the borrower to take the position that it is not in violation of anti-assignment provisions of its contracts; at the same time, we obtain the security interest in them by virtue of the UCC override

Sometimes a separate clause with respect to government authorizations is added as well

> (b) interest in any contracts, permits or licenses if the grant of a security interest or lien therein is prohibited as a matter of law or under the terms of such contracts, permits or licenses, in each case after giving effect to Article 9 of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable laws
> (p) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are prohibited thereby after giving effect to the applicable anti-non-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law

### Company proposal

> (r) any asset that is prohibited from being pledged by any contract or would require any consent, approval, license or other authorization of any third party or Governmental Authority to be pledged

See next slide for proposed revisions

## Prohibitions by Contract with Respect to All Assets

The customary exception described in the prior slide has been expanded over the years in many sponsor deals to say not just the contracts but any assets subject to such contracts will be excluded from collateral

If all assets that are prohibited to be pledged by any contract are excluded (as in the language on the right), the lenders could lose a lien on all personal property if the borrower has any agreement with an overbroad lien covenant that does not allow liens on any assets

This exclusion should apply only to contracts (i.e., actual contract rights, not property subject thereto), licenses and leases that are being pledged as marked up in the prior slide or should be revised as in the next slide

Alternative language is to agree to exclude any assets subject to:
- contractual provisions binding on such assets on the closing date [and expressly disclosed as such prior to the date hereof] or binding on such assets at the time of the acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition; or
- contractual obligations binding on such assets acquired after the date hereof at the time of such acquisition and not entered into in contemplation of such acquisition

> (r) any asset that is prohibited from being pledged by any contract or would require any consent, approval, license or other authorization of any third party (other than Holdings or its Subsidiaries) (provided that such prohibition or requirement existed on the Closing Date [and was disclosed to the Administrative Agent in writing] or at the time of the acquisition of such asset, as applicable, and was not entered into in contemplation thereof) or Governmental Authority to be pledged, which consent has not been obtained, in each case after giving effect to the applicable anti-non-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code

## Assets Subject to Capital Leases and Purchase Money Financing

> (e) assets subject to capital leases, purchase money financing and cash to secure letter of credit reimbursement obligations to the extent such capital leases, purchase money financing or letters of credit are permitted under the Loan Documentation and the terms thereof prohibit a grant of a security interest therein

Most lenders that provide capital leases and purchase money financing to the company will require the assets subject to such leases and financings to be free of any other liens, although some of such financings would permit our facilities to have a subordinated lien

To accommodate the borrower, it is customary to exclude such assets to the extent such capital leases or purchase money financings are permitted by the credit agreement

## Adverse Tax Consequences

When the financing includes only US loan parties, this exclusion is not really appropriate, but there are many sponsor precedents with this exclusion

**Sample 1:**
> (q) any asset to the extent the granting of a security interest in such asset would result in [material] / [non-de minimis adverse tax consequences to Sponsor, any parent entity, Holdings or any of its subsidiaries, as reasonably determined ~~in good faith~~ agreed to by Borrower and Administrative Agent

**Sample 2:**
> (q) any asset to the extent the granting of a security interest in such asset would result in [material] / [non-de minimis] adverse tax consequences to Sponsor, any parent entity, Holdings or any of its subsidiaries, as ~~reasonably~~ determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

Because the specified exclusions may not contemplate every situation that may arise in the future, usually a credit agreement allows the agent to agree to exclude specific assets from the collateral based on a cost-benefit analysis

**Sample 1 (Credit Agreement):**
> (1) those assets as to which ~~the Administrative Agent and the Borrower reasonably and mutually~~ agree in writing determines that the cost of obtaining such a security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the benefit to the Lenders of the security to be afforded thereby, ...

**Sample 2 (Credit Agreement):**
> (1) those assets as to which the Administrative Agent reasonably determines in good faith in consultation with the Borrower that the cost of obtaining such a security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the benefit to the Lenders of the security to be afforded thereby

**Cost-Benefit Analysis (Indentures)**
> any other assets to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the cost, burden, difficulty or consequence of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in such assets is excessive in relation to the benefit to the holders of the Notes of the security to be afforded thereby or the value of such assets as Collateral

Trustees under an indenture will not usually agree to exercise discretion in this manner, so indentures (even for first lien secured notes) will usually follow the credit agreement on this type of exclusion or will permit the issuer to make the determination

## Excluded Assets in ABL deals

Given the broad Excluded Asset definitions in most deals, we need to make clear that every asset in the borrowing base constitutes collateral

What language would we add in the definition of Excluded Assets to do this?

> (the foregoing described in clauses (a) through (s), are collectively, the "Excluded Assets");

## Excluded Assets in ABL deals

The language in blue should always be included in some form in ABL facilities

> (the foregoing described in clauses (a) through (s), are collectively, the "Excluded Assets"); provided that, in no event, shall any assets included in any Borrowing Base constitute Excluded Assets

## PERFECTION LIMITATIONS

### Perfection Limitations

Financing documents may explicitly state that the loan parties are not required to take certain steps for perfection of collateral or for obtaining third party agreements. The secured parties may still have a perfected lien on securities accounts and commodity accounts, unless the accounts are excluded from the collateral. 

**No control agreements** will be required for deposit accounts, securities accounts or commodity accounts

These limitations may include the following:
- **No landlord lien waivers, bailee waivers or other collateral access agreements** will be required (inclusion of inventory in the borrowing base would make it easier for the collateral agent to exercise its remedies and repossess collateral)
- **No notices will be required to be sent to account debtors** unless an event of default has occurred (this limitation should be subject to the following limitation unless such notice is required under applicable law in order for the collateral agent to have a perfected security interest in such account)
- No notices to, or acknowledgments from, counterparts under, or compliance with, the **Assignment of Claims Act** (or any state or municipal equivalent) will be required unless requested from the collateral agent during a continuing event of default (borrower has substantial government business)
- **No perfection steps under foreign law** unless there are non-US loan parties whose stock or assets are being pledged or non-US subsidiaries are permitted to be loan parties (and their assets would be pledged in such case), consider whether a pledge agreement under local law should be required

## GUARANTEE AND COLLATERAL RELEASE PROVISIONS

### Guarantee and Collateral Release Provisions

The credit agreement should have provisions that either authorize the administrative or collateral agent to release the liens and guarantees or provide for an automatic release of liens and guarantees

This provision is typically in the Administrative Agent or Miscellaneous articles

For more detail on the mechanics and documentation for payoff letters and collateral releases, see Academy presentation Joinders, Payoff Letters and Releases

### Release of Loan Parties Upon Payoff

All loan parties should be released from the loan documents upon termination and payoff of the facility

The survival provisions will specify which provisions survive such termination, but the security interests will be released in any event

The termination provision may be in the credit agreement or the security agreement

### Release of Loan Parties Upon Payoff

Cash management obligations and hedging obligations should not be required to be paid in full as a condition to payoff except in ABL deals where they are paid behind the loans in the application of proceeds section. Bracketed language should be added in ABL deals.

Language regarding treatment of letters of credit, if any, as a condition to termination should be added if not already in the precedent.

> All security interests granted pursuant to the loan documents shall automatically terminate when all Obligations are paid in full (except for (i) contingent indemnification and expense reimbursement obligations to which no claim has been made (in which case, these will survive termination of the credit agreement and the other loan documents) and (ii) any obligations pursuant to secured cash management agreements and secured hedging agreements [not then due and payable pursuant to the waterfall provisions of the Credit Agreement]); all Commitments are terminated; and all letters of credit (if any) have expired, been terminated or been cash collateralized, back-stopped or reissued under another agreement in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the letter of credit issuer and the administrative agent.

### Release of Loan Parties Other than Upon Payoff

A loan party may be released from its guarantee (and its security interests released) when it ceases to be a restricted subsidiary, e.g., because its equity interests are transferred to a non-loan party or because it is designated as an unrestricted subsidiary

If this is the release language, no Chewy protective language is needed:
> A Subsidiary Loan Party shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, and all security interests created by the Security Documents in Collateral owned by such Subsidiary Loan Party shall be automatically released, upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this Agreement or any designation in accordance with Section 5., as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary.

**Approach 1:**
> **Excluded Subsidiary** shall mean any of the following: (a) each Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary (but only for so long as such Subsidiary remains a non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary); provided, however, that no Subsidiary that becomes a non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary after the Closing Date shall be an Excluded Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (a) unless it also ceases to be a Subsidiary

In many financing documents, a loan party is released from its guarantee when it becomes an Excluded Subsidiary (i.e., a subsidiary that is not required to become a guarantor)

In such case, if the definition of Excluded Subsidiary includes non-wholly owned subsidiaries (as is common), discuss with the client whether **Chewy protective language** should be included (either in the term sheet or in the market flex)

Approach 1 is the more conservative (lender-friendly) version of Chewy protective language and should be proposed in non-sponsor and middle-market transactions

**Approach 2:**

Approach 2 is more borrower-friendly and may be proposed in sponsor transactions

Check the approach in the precedent documentation:
> A Subsidiary Loan Party (other than the Borrower) shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, and all security interests created by the Security Documents in Collateral owned by such Subsidiary Loan Party shall be automatically released upon the consummation of any single transaction or related series of transactions permitted by this Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party ceases to be a Loan Party (including pursuant to a merger with a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party, becoming an Excluded Subsidiary or a designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary); provided that no Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents and no security interest or Lien on the Collateral of or Equity Interest in such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released if such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary solely pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof unless such Subsidiary Guarantor became a non-wholly owned Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to a transaction where such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes a bona fide joint venture and the other Person obtaining the Equity Interests in such Subsidiary Guarantor is not an Affiliate of the Loan Parties (other than as a result of such joint venture).

### Release of Specific Assets

The release of liens on specific assets should occur only when one of the following is applicable: 
- the assets are disposed of pursuant to a transaction permitted by the credit agreement to a non-loan party (under the UCC, the security interest in any disposed collateral will continue unless the secured party authorized the disposition free and clear of the security interest)
- the asset becomes an Excluded Asset 
- the Required Lenders (or all lenders with respect to the release of all or substantially all assets) consent to the release

> (i) Upon any sale as part of or in connection with a Disposition by any Loan Party (other than to Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party) of any Collateral in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, (ii) if any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Documents becomes an Excluded Asset or (iii) upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the Lien or security interest created under any Security Document in any Collateral or the release of any Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to Section 9.02, the security interests in such Collateral created by the Security Documents or such Guarantee shall be automatically released. ... The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(iv) to the extent required by the terms of the obligations secured by such Liens pursuant to documents reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

The firm will often receive requests to release liens on collateral in connection with the incurrence of permitted liens

**Most permitted liens, including pari passu and junior liens, should not result in the termination of the agents liens**

These provisions should be limited to purchase money liens and liens on after-acquired assets binding on such assets at the time of their acquisition

## Security Agreements, Part II

### Overview of Part II

- Filing Authorization
- Representations and Warranties
- Covenants
- Remedies and Enforcement Provisions
- Miscellaneous Provisions
- Exhibits and Schedules
- Selected Resources for Secured Transactions

### Filing Authorization

Under the UCC in order to file a financing statement, the secured party must be authorized by the debtor to make the filing

Each security agreement will include a broad authorization for the agent to make filings (including amendments and continuations), and in the case of all asset security to describe the assets as all assets

> Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent at any time and from time to time to file in any relevant jurisdiction any initial financing statements (including fixture filings) with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof and amendments thereto, including continuations, that (i) describe the collateral covered thereby in any manner that the Collateral Agent reasonably determines is necessary or advisable to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted under this Agreement, including indicating the Collateral as all assets of such Grantor or words of similar effect, and (ii) contain the information required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or the analogous legislation of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any financing statement or amendment, including (A) whether such Grantor is an organization, the type of organization and any organizational identification number issued to such Grantor, if applicable, and (B) in the case of a financing statement filed as a fixture filing, a sufficient description of the real property to which such Collateral relates. Each Grantor agrees to provide such information to the Collateral Agent promptly upon the Collateral Agents reasonable request.

**Q: True or False: Trustees keep track of UCC financing statements and their expiration/renewal dates.**

**A: False.** Unlike collateral agents that are traditional banks, trustees do not file UCC financing statements and do not keep track of when they expire and must be renewed.

In bond deals, and other transactions where an agent-for-hire is used, this provision will also include an affirmative obligation on the loan parties to make filings

Trustees and other agents-for-hire will not undertake to make security filings

> Each Grantor agrees to deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent such UCC financing statements, in form reasonably acceptable to the Notes Collateral Agent, as are required, or as the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of Majority Notes Creditors) may from time to time reasonably request to establish and maintain a valid, enforceable, perfected security interest in the Collateral as provided herein and for the purpose of obtaining and preserving the full benefits of the other rights and security contemplated hereby at least to the extent described in Section 2.1. Each Grantor will pay any applicable filing fees, recordation taxes and related expenses relating to its Collateral. Each Grantor shall file any such UCC financing statements in the Office of the Secretary of State or equivalent office designated in its Location. Each Grantor authorizes the Notes Collateral Agent to make such filings, but the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to make such filings, and such authorization includes describing the Collateral as all assets and all personal property whether now owned or hereafter acquired of such Grantor or words of similar effect.

## REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

### Representations and Warranties Generally

The loan parties will make various representations to the agent under the security agreement, which are generally more specific than the representations included in the credit agreement

Every security agreement should have representations requiring that the following assets be listed on schedules to the security agreement or in the perfection certificate (as described in further detail below):

- Equity interests
- Promissory notes and other instruments (usually subject to threshold)
- Intellectual property
- Commercial tort claims (unless excluded from the collateral)

### Reps Regarding Certain Categories of Assets

The following representations relating to schedules of assets will typically be made as of the closing date, and then there will be a separate covenant to take the perfection steps and make the deliveries with respect to assets acquired after the closing date.

**Pledged Equity and Pledged Debt**
- That the equity interests, debt securities and tangible chattel paper required to be pledged as of the closing date are listed on a schedule, and the certificate numbers associated with such equity interests are set forth therein
- This representation identifies the possessory collateral that is required to be delivered to the agent

**Intellectual Property**
- That patents, trademarks, copyrights and exclusive licenses of copyrights owned as of the closing date are listed on a schedule
- This representation identifies the intellectual property for which filings are to be made in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and U.S. Copyright Office

**Commercial Torts**
- That commercial tort claims (exceeding a specified threshold) as of the closing date are described on a schedule 
- Commercial tort claims are an exception to the rule that assets can be described by category; accordingly, in order for a security interest to be granted over a commercial tort claim, it must be specifically described

Depending on the business deal, and specifically, the deliverables that are required, there may be additional representations relating to scheduling of assets

| Type of Deal | Representation Required |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Bank accounts | Deals that require control agreements for bank accounts |
| Locations of property | Deals that require landlord waivers or bailee agreements (e.g., ABL facilities) |
| Letters of credit | Deals that require control of letters of credit (where the loan party is a beneficiary of the letter of credit) |

- That bank accounts are listed on a schedule, identifying which bank accounts are required to be subject to control agreements (and if not required, the reason for the exclusion)
- That locations that are leased or where assets are held by third parties are listed on a schedule, identifying which locations are required to be subject to landlord waivers or bailee agreements (and if not required, the reason for the exclusion)
- That letters of credit above a threshold (aligning to the threshold for such control) as of the closing date are listed on a schedule

### General Security Reps

Often these representations are included in the credit agreement, but may also be in the security agreement

**Creation, perfection and priority of security interests**
- That the security agreement creates a valid security in favor of the agent for the benefit of the secured parties in the collateral
- That upon the taking of the steps specified in the representation (e.g., filing UCC financing statements, delivering stock certificates), the security interest of the agent for the benefit of the secured parties in the collateral is a perfected security interest
- That the security interest of the agent is a first priority security interest, or that the security interest is subject to no liens other than permitted liens

**Transactional representations**
- The loan parties own the collateral free and clear of liens other than permitted liens
- The collateral is transferable
- The pledged equity is duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable
- Reps relating to the specific collateral
- No consents, authorizations, or government filings are required
- Due authorization and execution
- Enforceability

## COVENANTS

### Covenants Generally

Security agreements generally contain a litany of covenants relating to the collateral

### Perfection: Possessory Collateral

Typically, a security agreement will include a covenant to deliver certificates evidencing pledged equity to the agent accompanied by stock powers, and a covenant to deliver instruments evidencing debt (usually subject to a threshold) to the agent accompanied by instruments of transfer

Ideally, there would be a specific time period following acquisition of such equity interests or instruments during which such deliveries must be made

In some transactions, a supplement to the pledged equity and/or pledged debt schedule (which may be in the form of an exhibit to the security agreement) must be delivered at the time such certificates or instruments are delivered

### Perfection: Intellectual Property

Typically, a security agreement will include a covenant to notify the agent of new intellectual property, and to provide **IP** filings

The notification requirement may be within a specific time period following acquisition of such intellectual property or periodically (such as annually or quarterly)

The materiality of **IP** to the loan parties and the frequency of when the loan parties acquire IP should be considered in negotiating the provision

The agent would be authorized to make IP filings related to the new **IP**

The security agreement typically attaches the form of **IP** filings as exhibits
- See the Academy presentation Selected Specialized Collateral Documentation for more information about intellectual property security agreements

> **After-Acquired Property.** If any Pledgor shall at any time after the date hereof (i) obtain any rights to any additional Intellectual Property Collateral or (ii) become entitled to the benefit of any additional Intellectual Property Collateral or any renewal or extension thereof, including any reissue, division, continuation, or continuation-in-part of any Intellectual Property Collateral, or any improvement on any Intellectual Property Collateral, or if any intent-to use trademark application is no longer subject to clause (c) of the definition of Excluded Property, the provisions hereof shall automatically apply thereto and any such item enumerated in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall automatically constitute Intellectual Property Collateral as if such would have constituted Intellectual Property Collateral at the time of execution hereof and be subject to the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement without further action by any party. Each Pledgor shall promptly (and in any event within [ ] days) provide to the Collateral Agent written notice of any of the foregoing and confirm the attachment of the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement to any rights described in clauses (i) and (ii) above by execution of an instrument in form reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent and the filing of any instruments or statements as shall be reasonably necessary to create, preserve, protect or perfect the Collateral Agents security interest in such Intellectual Property Collateral, including prompt recordals with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, as applicable. Further, each Pledgor authorizes the Collateral Agent to modify this Agreement by amending Schedules [ ] to include any Intellectual Property Collateral of such Pledgor acquired or arising after the date hereof.

### Commercial Tort Claims

Typically, the security agreement will include a covenant to notify the agent of any new commercial tort claims, and to grant a security interest in such commercial tort claims (e.g., by delivering a supplement to the security agreement that specifically identifies the commercial tort claim and includes a grant of a security interest)

> **Commercial Tort Claims.** As of the date hereof, each Pledgor hereby represents and warrants that it holds no Commercial Tort Claims other than those listed in Schedule [ ]. If any Pledgor shall at any time hold or acquire a Commercial Tort Claim, such Pledgor shall immediately notify the Collateral Agent in writing signed by such Pledgor of the brief details thereof and grant to the Collateral Agent in such writing a security interest therein and in the Proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. The requirement in the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the amount of such Commercial Tort Claim, together with the amount of all other Commercial Tort Claims held by any Pledgor in which the Collateral Agent does not have a security interest, does not exceed $[ ] in the aggregate for all Pledgors.

### Issuers Acknowledgments

If pledged equity interests are uncertificated (and therefore cannot be physically delivered), an issuer acknowledgment (which serves as a control agreement under the UCC) can assure the priority of the secured partys lien on such equity interests; however, only securities can be perfected by control and accordingly this requirement applies only to uncertificated securities

In certain transactions, when a pledgor acquires any new uncertificated securities, such pledgor is required (i) to have the issuer of such securities execute an issuers acknowledgment and (ii) to deliver such issuers acknowledgment to the agent

The form of issuers acknowledgment may be included as an exhibit to the security agreement in such deals

Sponsor counsels often push back on issuer acknowledgments as burdensome

We can include an issuer acknowledgment within the security agreement itself for issuers that are also pledgors

### Perfection: Control Agreements

In transactions where control agreements over bank accounts are required, there will be a covenant to deliver control agreements (within a time period) for any bank account that is opened, acquired, or that ceases to be an excluded account after the closing date

Control agreements may also be required for securities accounts (security account control agreement) and for commodity accounts (commodity account control agreement)

We do not recommend attaching forms of control agreements, as they generally follow forms provided by the account bank, securities intermediary or commodity account provider

See the Academy presentation Selected Specialized Collateral Documentation for more information about control agreements

### Further Assurances

Covenant to take additional actions, and deliver additional documents, as the agent may request to better assure and confirm the validity, enforceability, perfection and priority of the security interest under the security agreement

This is a catch-all to protect the secured party in case an action not specifically required by the covenants is needed to obtain the security interest

### Changes in Loan Party Information

> No Grantor shall change its name, convert into another type of legal entity, change its jurisdiction of formation (whether by reincorporation, merger or otherwise) or change the location of its chief executive office, except in each case upon giving not less than ten (10) days prior written notice (or such other period as reasonably agreed to by the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent and, substantially contemporaneously with such change, taking or causing to be taken at such Grantors expense all such Perfection Actions, including the delivery of such Perfection Documents, to perfect or protect, or maintain the perfection and priority of, the Lien of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in Collateral contemplated hereunder.

Under the UCC, if a loan party changes its name or jurisdiction of organization, the UCC must be amended within 4 months of the change in order to continue to be effective

Accordingly, every security agreement should include a covenant on the loan parties to notify the agent of any such changes

The notice periods vary, from some time before effecting any change to 3days after the change (or sometimes longer)

If the UCC amendment is not filed within the 4-month period, the UCC lapses, and any UCC financing statement filed during the intervening period would have priority

If you learn that a UCC amendment was not filed within the 4-month period, notify the partner immediately, run lien searches and discuss if the client should consider other measures (such as blocking use of the revolving facility until the failure is fully remedied)

### Other Covenants

A security agreement may have deal specific covenants, for example, if there are motor vehicles included in the collateral for which documents of title are required to be delivered, there will be a covenant requiring same, or if there are landlord waivers or bailee letters or control arrangements relating to letters of credit, there will be covenants requiring delivery of same

There will also be general covenants, such as covenants to defend title to the collateral

## REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS

### Remedies and Enforcement Provisions Generally

These are provisions that describe the rights and the remedies of the agent upon default

Rights and remedies are triggered upon an Event of Default or an Event of Default plus notice

**Practice Tip:** For this notice provision, avoid formulations that require at least [ ] days notice or reasonable notice

Every security agreement should provide that, upon such triggering event, the **agent is entitled to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the UCC (whether or not applicable)**

### Remedies: Equity Interests; Voting Rights and Distributions

Typically, there is a provision in the security agreement that sets forth the rights with respect to equity interests before, and during, the occurrence of an event of default

It is important to ensure that the defined term used in this section for the equity interests (e.g., pledged collateral, pledged equity, pledged securities) is broad enough to cover all applicable equity interests (and is not limited to securities or equity interests evidenced by a stock certificate)

Form security agreements have a provision requiring the borrower, at the agents request following foreclosure, to file registration statements with the SEC to allow public sale of equity interests

A registered offering is unlikely to be used, so this requirement may be removed if requested

Loan parties may exercise such rights for any purposes not inconsistent with the credit agreement

Loan parties may receive and retain such distributions, to the extent made in accordance with the credit agreement

Exception for non-cash distributions (e.g., if the distribution is in the form of additional equity that is certificated) that the security agreement requires to be delivered to the agent

Agent has the right to exercise all voting and other rights of the owner of pledged equity

However in practice, our clients do not exercise voting rights due to lender liability concerns

Agent has the right to divert all distributions in respect of pledged equity interests and apply them to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the waterfall specified in the loan documents

### Remedies: Grant of Intellectual Property License

Security agreements generally include a provision whereby the loan parties grant to the agent a license to use, assign, license or sublicense intellectual property of the loan parties

This enables the agent to use intellectual property in connection with exercise of remedies (e.g., to use a trademark on inventory in connection with a sale by the agent of inventory during foreclosure)

The license should be a world-wide, irrevocable, royalty free license

Typically, the license is exercisable during an event of default

### Remedies: Sales of Collateral

Typically, a security agreement will provide that the agent may take possession of and sell the collateral during an event of default

The security agreement should include a provision that to the extent notice of sale or disposition of the collateral is required by law, 1days notice is commercially reasonable notice

Waivers of rights and claims that the loan parties may have

It is unusual in syndicated term loan B financings for the secured party to actually exercise remedies like foreclosing on collateral (less uncommon in ABL financings)

In distressed situations, the parties typically negotiate a restructuring or the loan parties seek bankruptcy protection

However, these rights are important to provide leverage to the secured parties, and also in the event that the rights are necessary to be exercised

These rights are standard in the market and expected by our clients

### Remedies: Power of Attorney

Typically, a security agreement includes a power of attorney that allows the agent to act in the name of the loan parties and to execute documents in the name of the loan parties

Typically, the power of attorney is exercisable only during an event of default

### Application of Proceeds (waterfall) Provision

This provision specifies how the proceeds received by the agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other realization upon all or any part of the collateral pursuant to the exercise of remedies should be applied

In most of our deals, this provision will refer to the waterfall provision in the credit agreement

In any event there should not be separate waterfall provisions in the credit agreement and the security agreement that are different

## MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

### Joinders of Loan Parties

This is the mechanic to add additional loan parties to the security agreement

Typically, a form of joinder will be attached as an exhibit to the security agreement

A joinder must include a grant of a security interest

Schedules must be provided in connection with a joinder

If there are schedules to the security agreement, supplements to the schedules must be provided

If the security agreement refers to the perfection certificate, the joinder provision should include a requirement to deliver a perfection certificate supplement for the joining loan party

For more information about joinders, see the Academy presentation Joinders, Payoff Letters and Releases and the resource Sample Joinder Closing Checklist

### Termination and Release Provisions

The release mechanics are negotiated in the credit agreement, and the security agreement should match the corresponding provisions in the credit agreement

There are three types of releases that occur:

- Release of a loan party and the liens granted by the released loan party, which occurs when a subsidiary is released from its obligations under the loan documents (e.g., if it ceases to be a restricted subsidiary)
- Release of specific collateral, which occurs if (x) the asset is sold to a person that is not a loan party in a transaction permitted under the credit agreement or (y) if the asset becomes Excluded Property
- Release of all of the loan parties and all of the collateral, which occurs in connection with a payoff

Typically, the release provision in the security agreement will provide that upon a release or termination, the agent is required to return possessory collateral and deliver documents and instruments to evidence the termination and release

This provision may include filing of UCC terminations, but should NOT include authorizations for the loan parties to file UCC terminations (except in secured notes offerings)

### Governing Law

Will be New York law for most of our transactions

The law governing the security agreement is also the law that governs creation

If the security agreement is governed by NY law, then the New York UCC will govern creation (and the creation opinion will be given by New York counsel)

### Amendments

Should provide that amendments or waivers must be in writing and signed by the loan parties and the agent, subject to any consents of the lenders required by the credit agreement

### Intercreditor Legends

Many intercreditor agreements include a provision that specifies that a specific legend must be included in the security agreement, and the intercreditor agreements (if any) should be reviewed to ensure that any required legend is included in the security agreement

Generally, a security agreement will include a provision that specifies that in the event of a conflict between the security agreement and the intercreditor agreement, the intercreditor agreement will control

So long as the controlling facility is outstanding, certain rights of the agent under the non-controlling facility (such as holding possessory collateral and settling insurance claims) will be reserved for the agent under the controlling facility

See the Academy presentations Intercreditor Agreements, Parts I-III for more information about intercreditor agreements

### Exhibits and Schedules

Exhibits to security agreements typically include forms of the following:

| Exhibit | When Used |
|---------|-----------|
| Joinder | New loan party being added |
| Pledge Supplement (sometimes not included) | Additional pledged securities being delivered by existing loan party |
| Issuers Acknowledgment (often not included) | Uncertificated securities are pledged |
| Trademark Security Agreement | Additional trademark assets at USPTO being pledged |
| Patent Security Agreement | Additional patents being pledged |
| Copyright Security Agreement | Additional copyright assets at USCO being pledged |

For easier navigation, we recommend that security agreements include a table of contents (our word processing department can assist with this) and a list of schedules and exhibits to the security agreement (unless we are closely following precedent and the precedent does not include them)

### What is a Security Agreement?

A security agreement is an agreement entered into by one or more debtors and a secured party pursuant to which the debtor(s) grant a security interest to the secured party

The security agreement governs the terms upon which the security interest is granted, perfected, administered and enforced

The agreement may be referred to as:
- security agreement
- collateral agreement
- security and pledge agreement
- guarantee and collateral agreement: this document also includes the guarantee
- pledge agreement: typically when the collateral is limited to equity interests and/or debt
- credit and security agreement: when the security grant is included within the credit agreement itself; unusual, but sometimes used in smaller deals

Unless the context requires, references in this presentation to security agreement refers to any of the above documents

### Types of Transactions and Terminology

Security agreements are used in secured financings, typically secured credit agreements, but also secured notes transactions

In this presentation, we will use terminology for credit facilities (e.g., borrower, loan parties and agent) but the concepts discussed herein apply analogously to other secured financings

This presentation does not address security agreements governed by non-US law

### Scope of Assets

The types of security agreements we work on cover assets in which the granting of a lien is governed by Article 9 of the UCC
- Generally, Article 9 is applicable to personal property and fixtures

Article 9 does not apply to real estate
- Other exceptions are set forth in Section 9-109 of the UCC

**Q: What should you have on hand when drafting or reviewing a security agreement?**

**A: You should have the following on hand when drafting or reviewing a security agreement:**

1. Term sheet
2. Agreed precedent of security agreement (if any) and other relevant precedents
3. Draft credit agreement
4. Draft perfection certificate
5. Draft intercreditor agreement (if available)

### Reflecting the Business Agreement

Make sure that the security agreement reflects agreed business terms

**Practice Tip:** Be familiar with and refer frequently to the sections of the term sheet and the credit agreement that relate to guarantee and collateral matters

Align dollar/materiality thresholds to those in the perfection certificate and/or the term sheet if those have been agreed

### All Asset vs. Specific Assets

An all asset security agreement is an agreement pursuant to which the loan parties grant security over all asset categories, subject to certain negotiated exclusions (such as in a definition of Excluded Property or Excluded Assets)

In certain deals, it is agreed as a business matter that a security interest will be granted only over specific assets, and in such instances the security agreement will cover only those specific assets

In certain deals, the collateral provided by holdings will be limited to the equity interests in the borrower, and holdings will not sign the all asset security agreement, but will instead sign a separate pledge agreement, and be subject to the holdings covenant in the credit agreement

### Parties to the Security Agreement

The security agreement will be signed by the debtors
- Typically, this will be all loan parties (the borrower and the guarantors)
- The loan parties will become party to the security agreement by (i) signing the security agreement on the closing date or (ii) signing a joinder to the security agreement after closing
- The security agreement will typically have a definition of Grantors or Pledgors, which must include all of the loan parties that sign on the closing date and all loan parties that become party to the security agreement after the closing date by executing a joinder or supplement

The security agreement will be signed by the secured party
- For credit agreements, the secured party will be the administrative agent or the collateral agent or agent; whichever is appointed under the credit agreement to hold the collateral
- For secured notes transactions, the secured party will typically be the notes collateral agent or the collateral agent appointed under the indenture

**Practice Tip:** Review financing statements to ensure that it refers to the agent in the same capacity as the security agreement. If the security agreement grants a security interest to collateral agent the financing statements should refer to collateral agent and if the security agreement grants a security interest to administrative agent the financing statement should refer to administrative agent.

> This SECURITY AGREEMENT dated as of [ ] (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof, this "Agreement") made by [ ], a [ ] (the "Borrower"), and the Guarantors from to time to time party hereto (the "Guarantors"), as pledgors, assignors and debtors (the Borrower, together with the Guarantors, in such capacities and together with any successors in such capacities, the "Pledgors," and each, a "Pledgor"), in favor of], in its capacity as collateral agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined), as pledgee, assignee and secured party (in such capacities and together with any successors in such capacities, the "Collateral Agent").

The UCC financing statement for this deal should refer to the **Collateral Agent**

### Definitions and Interpretive Provisions

Where possible, terms should be defined by reference to the credit agreement or indenture rather than having duplicative definitions
- This avoids inconsistencies, and makes amendments more efficient, as amendments can be done by amending the credit agreement without also amending the security agreement

Categories of collateral used in the granting clause (e.g., deposit accounts, general intangibles, investment property) should be defined by reference to the UCC
- Although broader definitions or definitions that match the definition in the UCC are acceptable, the definition should be inclusive of the term as defined in the UCC

### NOTES OFFERINGS

In bond deals, especially where the security agreement is based on the security agreement for the credit agreement, defined terms need to be carefully reviewed, as the indenture will be structured differently from the credit agreement. For example:
- There typically would need to be a definition of Notes which should include Additional Notes
- Defined terms such as Excluded Property or defined terms used in the definition of Excluded Property that are not defined in the indenture may need to be added from the Description of Notes (DON)
- Defined terms, such as MAE that are not defined in the indenture or the DON may need to be added from the credit agreement

### NOTES OFFERINGS

In an indenture, the term Obligations is typically defined to mean the obligations under any debt instrument, rather than the obligations that are intended to be secured under the security agreement

> **Obligations** means any principal, interest (including any interest, fees, expenses and other amounts accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding at the rate provided for in the documentation with respect thereto, whether or not such interest, fees, expenses and other amounts are an allowed or allowable claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law), penalties, fees, indemnifications, reimbursements, damages and other liabilities payable under the documentation governing any Indebtedness.

Accordingly, in a bond deal, a defined term for Notes Obligations or Secured Obligations describing the obligations to be secured under the security agreement will typically need to be added to the security agreement

> **Secured Obligations** means all Obligations (as defined in the Indenture) whether direct or indirect (including those acquired by assumption), absolute or contingent, due or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising (including any interest, fees and other amount which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to any Grantor, would have accrued on any Obligation, whether or not such interest, fees or other amount is an allowed claim under applicable law) in respect of the Notes and the other Senior Secured Notes Documents.

### SECURITY AGREEMENTS SECURING MULTIPLE FACILITIES

In certain transactions, the security agreement will secure the obligations under multiple facilities (for example, the obligations under an indenture and other pari debt that is added to the security agreement)

Definitions such as Secured Parties and Secured Obligations should be reviewed to ensure that the correct parties and obligations are included

Definitions such as Permitted Liens and Event of Default should be reviewed to ensure that they capture all the facilities

Release mechanics to be reviewed to ensure that there is a mechanic to release collateral and loan parties with respect to (i) specific facilities and (ii) all facilities

Amendment mechanics to be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the facilities documentation

The security agreement should have a provision that provides that the rules of interpretation from the credit agreement or the indenture, as applicable, are applicable to the security agreement

## GRANTING CLAUSE

### The Granting Clause

The granting clause is the provision of security agreement where the security interest is granted by the debtor to the agent over its assets

> **Grant of Security Interest.** As collateral security for the payment and performance in full of all the Secured Obligations, each Pledgor hereby pledges and grants to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a lien on and security interest in all of the right, title and interest of such Pledgor in, to and under the following property, wherever located, and whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired from time to time (collectively, the "Pledged Collateral"):

> (i) all Accounts;
> (ii) all Equipment, Goods, Inventory and Fixtures;
> (iii) all Documents, Instruments and Chattel Paper;
> (iv) all Letters of Credit and Letter-of-Credit Rights;
> (v) all Securities Collateral;
> (vi) all Investment Property;
> (vii) all Intellectual Property Collateral;
> (viii) the Commercial Tort Claims described on Schedule to the Perfection Certificate;
> (ix) all General Intangibles;
> (x) all Money and all Deposit Accounts;
> (xi) all Supporting Obligations;
> (xii) all books and records relating to the Pledged Collateral; and
> (xiii) to the extent not covered by clauses (i) through (xii) of this sentence, all other personal property of such Pledgor, whether tangible or intangible, and all Proceeds and products of each of the foregoing and all accessions to, substitutions and replacements for, and rents, profits and products of, each of the foregoing, any and all Proceeds of any insurance, indemnity, warranty or guaranty payable to such Pledgor from time to time with respect to any of the foregoing.

> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clauses (i) through (xiii) above, the security interest created by this Agreement shall not extend to, and the term Pledged Collateral shall not include, any Excluded Property.

### UCC Requirements for Description of Collateral for the Granting Clause

Under the UCC, a description of collateral is sufficient, whether or not it is specific, if **it reasonably identifies what is described**

A description reasonably identifies the collateral if **it identifies the collateral by category**

Exception for Commercial Tort Claims, which must be described specifically, not as a general category

Under the UCC, a supergeneric description of collateral is not sufficient for the granting clause (although it is sufficient for the UCC-1 financing statement)

A description of collateral as all the debtors assets or all the debtors personal property or using words of similar import does not reasonably identify the collateral

### UCC Collateral Categories

- **Accounts** means accounts receivable (not bank accounts), but the term expressly excludes all Instruments, Chattel Paper and Payment Intangibles, which all evidence a right to payment as well
- **Goods** include Inventory, Equipment, Fixtures, Timber, Crops and Unborn Young of Animals
- **General Intangibles** include all contracts rights, all intellectual property and all Payment Intangibles
- **Instruments** include promissory notes and checks
- **Deposit Accounts** are bank accounts that contain cash (demand deposits) and certificates of deposit
- **Investment Property** includes Securities (e.g., Equity Interests), Securities Accounts, Security Entitlements, Commodity Accounts and Commodity Contracts
- **Securities Accounts** are brokerage accounts that contain stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities
  - The rights of the debtor with respect to Securities Accounts and the assets therein are called **Security Entitlements**
- **Chattel Paper** includes agreements that evidence a lease of personal property goods or a sale on credit obligation that is secured by the sold goods
- **Commercial Tort Claims** are potential rights of the debtor against third parties arising in tort
- **Documents** include bills of lading, warehouse receipts and other documents that evidence title to the goods while goods are in possession of a third party
- **Letter-of-Credit Rights** are rights that the debtor has under a letter of credit for which the debtor is the beneficiary
- **Money**
- **Oil, gas and other minerals before extraction**
- **Proceeds:** the granting clause should always include proceeds of all other categories of collateral
- **Supporting Obligations** include letter-of-credit rights and other secondary obligations (such as guaranties) that support the payment or performance of any Account, Chattel Paper, Document, General Intangible, Instrument or Investment Property that constitutes collateral

### All Asset Collateral Description vs. Asset-Specific Collateral Description

In an all asset security agreement, the collateral is described by category as noted above

An all asset security agreement will often have two granting clauses
- There will be a specific clause granting security over pledged equity and pledged debt and a separate all asset granting clause
- Typically, the agent will have special rights with respect to pledged equity and pledged debt as further described below

In a transaction where it has been agreed as a business matter that a security interest will be granted only over specific assets, then those assets will need to be described in the granting clause in a manner that reasonably identifies the assets intended to constitute collateral

### Asset-Specific Collateral Description

> As security for the payment or performance, as the case may be, in full of all Secured Obligations, each Grantor hereby assigns and pledges to the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties and hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties a security interest in the Pledged Collateral.

> **Pledged Collateral** shall mean the collective reference to the following: all of such Grantors right, title and interest in, to and under (a)(i) the shares of capital stock and other Equity Interests owned by such Grantor, including those listed opposite the name of such Grantor on Schedule II, (ii) any other Equity Interests obtained in the future by such Grantor and (iii) the certificates (if any) representing all such Equity Interests (collectively, the "Pledged Equity Interests"); provided that the Pledged Equity Interests shall not include any Excluded Assets (the Equity Interests excluded pursuant to this proviso being referred to as the "Excluded Equity Interests"); (b)(i) the debt securities owned by such Grantor, including those listed opposite the name of such Grantor on Schedule II, (ii) any debt securities in the future issued to or otherwise acquired by such Grantor and (iii) the promissory notes and any other instruments evidencing all such debt securities (collectively, the "Pledged Debt Securities"); (c) all other property that may be delivered to and held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.01 and Section 2.02; (d) subject to Section 2.06, all payments of principal or interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, in exchange for or upon the conversion of, and all other Proceeds received in respect of, the securities referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above; (e) subject to Section 2.06, all rights and privileges of such Grantor with respect to the securities and other property referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above; and (f) all Proceeds of any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pledged Collateral shall not include Excluded Assets of any kind.

### Language to be included in Granting Clause

No specific language is required to create a security interest: the phrase **grant a security interest** is sufficient

The security interest should be granted to the [Agent]* and its successors and assigns for the benefit of the [Secured Parties]

The granting clause should provide that the collateral secures all [Secured Obligations]*
- This defined term varies – agreements use, *inter alia*, Secured Obligations, Obligations, Loan Obligations, Finance Obligations, Notes Obligations
- It is important to check the credit agreement and, if applicable, the intercreditor agreements for all potential definitions – as credit agreements will often include multiple definitions – to ensure that the correct definition (rather than a component definition) is being used and all section references are correct

**Practice Tip:** Make sure you are always using the correct defined terms used in the underlying debt agreement

The granting clause should include all now existing and after-acquired assets **and assets in which a debtor now or hereafter has rights, title or interest**
- Reference to owned assets is insufficient, as the rights of the debtor in an asset may not be an ownership interest (e.g., a debtors rights under a lease)

## Intercreditor Agreements, Part I

### Overview

- Purpose and common types of intercreditor agreements
- Important bankruptcy concepts
  - Classification of debt
  - Turnover
  - Rights as unsecured creditors
- Intercreditor agreement basics
- First lien / second lien intercreditor agreements
  - Standard provisions
  - Customary bankruptcy provisions

## PURPOSE AND COMMON TYPES OF INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS

### What is an Intercreditor Agreement?

An agreement between or among creditors (or their representative) of the loan parties* setting forth their respective rights and obligations with respect to the loan parties and their assets

In most deals we work on these days, intercreditor agreements are among **secured** creditors
- In most secured deals, different creditor classes intend to have the same collateral package with the same (pari passu) priority of security interests or with different (senior/junior) priority of security interests or different priority as to proceeds of collateral, but there are some deals (less typical) where the collateral is intended to be different (e.g., a letter of credit facility with limited collateral)

Subordination agreements among unsecured creditors are also considered intercreditor agreements

Creditors may be lenders under a credit agreement (re the collateral agent), bondholders (re the collateral trustee) or other debt holders

The classes of creditors may have separate sets of debt documents and separate liens under separate collateral documents and security filings, or may be party to the same debt document and have the benefit of combined liens/combined filings or separate liens/separate filings

Intercreditor agreements allow debtors to create more complex capital structures than just debt/equity or unsecured debt/secured debt

*In this presentation, references to borrower also includes issuer of bonds, and loan party also includes guarantors of bonds.

### Objectives of Intercreditor Agreements

Provide clarify on creditor vs. creditor relationships in the event that the debtor is unable to pay all claims of all creditors in full, including in bankruptcy
- Intercreditor agreements are generally respected in bankruptcy under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides:
  > A subordination agreement is enforceable in a [bankruptcy case] to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.

Specify who may control enforcement of remedies against the debtor

Specify pre-agreed limitations on exercise of certain creditor rights in bankruptcy

### Intercreditor Agreements for Creditors Under Separate Debt Documents

In the most common types of intercreditor agreements we work on, generally the classes of creditors have separate sets of debt and collateral documents and security filings

In certain pari passu lien transactions (e.g., Apollo deals and bond deals), the classes of creditors have separate sets of debt documents, but shared collateral documents and security filings

**Examples:**
- First Lien Credit Agreement / Second Lien Credit Agreement
- First Lien Credit Agreement / Second Lien Secured Notes
- ABL Credit Agreement (typically revolving facilities) / Cash Flow Credit Agreement (typically term loans)# Part 5 - Intercreditor Agreements Continued

**First Lien Credit Agreement / First Lien Secured Notes**

## Intercreditor Agreements for Creditors Under the Same Debt Documents

- Second lien creditors have liens on shared collateral that are subordinated to the liens securing the 1L creditors

- ABL has first priority on current assets and second priority on fixed assets; Cash Flow has first priority on fixed assets and second priority on current assets

- Creditors have same priority on shared collateral, and agree on who will control enforcement of liens

## Intercreditor Agreements for Creditors Under Same Debt Documents

There may be situations where creditors under a single set of loan and collateral documents agree to have different priorities on the proceeds of collateral

Debtor may favor such a structure:
- to save legal costs on documentation
- because amendments and waivers may be easier to obtain since typically covenants and most other provisions may be amended or waived with consent of the majority lenders considered on a combined basis for all tranches under the credit agreement, whereas majority lenders under each tranche would be required if each tranche were documented under a separate credit agreement

## Intercreditor Agreements for Creditors Under

**Examples:**
- Cash Flow Credit Agreement, with superpriority revolver
- ABL Credit Agreement, with FILO tranche
- First Lien Credit Agreement, with senior tranche and junior tranche

The arrangements among creditors are typically included within the credit agreement or security agreement itself, in the waterfall section. As a matter of practice, we seek to have separate grants of security interests in the security documents, to make separate security filings, and to include certain bankruptcy-related provisions in the waterfall section.

Typically arrangements among creditors are documented in an **Agreement Among Lenders (AAL)**

- In an enforcement scenario, the superpriority tranche gets paid first out of collateral proceeds
- In an enforcement scenario, FILO tranche receives payment after the first out tranche is paid in full out of collateral proceeds
- AAL specifies allocation of payments following an enforcement event

## IMPORTANT BANKRUPTCY CONCEPTS IN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS

### Classification of Debt

Particularly in deals with separate credit agreements and different priority liens, creditors expect to be treated as a separate class for bankruptcy purposes

Even in deals where different tranches under a single credit agreement have different priorities on proceeds of collateral (such as a FILO), we include language for the lenders of all tranches to acknowledge separate classification

Separate classification may affect the creditors right to vote on a plan of reorganization in bankruptcy

As noted in a prior Academy program, in order for the bankruptcy court to confirm a plan, more than 1/2 in number, and at least 2/3 in amount, by class of similarly situated creditors, must vote in favor to carry the class, and at least one class of impaired creditors must vote in favor
- Separate classification is very important for the senior creditors in situations where the junior debt is more than 2/3 of the total

> **Acknowledgement of Liens.** The Borrower and all other Grantors and each Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that because of, among other things, their differing rights to payment and to the proceeds of the Collateral or all other collateral (including as set forth in Section ), the Priority Payment Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the other Secured Obligations and must be separately classified in any Plan of Reorganization proposed, confirmed, or adopted in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

If different tranches share one lien, a creditor that is oversecured with respect to its tranche may not be able to recover post-petition interest, fees, or expenses because the total loan is undersecured (this is sometimes referred to as the Ionosphere issue, arising out of the case **In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc.** (S.D.N.Y. 1995))

Under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, only oversecured creditors are entitled to post-petition interest, fees, and expenses

Definition of Obligations should include post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, whether or not a claim therefor is allowed or allowable in any insolvency proceeding

### Turnover

Parties agree that they should be separately classified under a plan, but if they are not, and the senior lien creditors by themselves otherwise would have been oversecured, the junior lien creditors agree to turn over any proceeds they receive under a plan to enable the senior lien creditors to receive post-petition interest, fees and expenses

Note that, in a turnover, the junior lien creditor is turning over recoveries that it would have received in respect of its claims; the junior lien creditors claims are deemed satisfied to such extent, even though the recovery is going to the senior lien creditor

The junior lien creditors claims do not become unsecured claims but are actually reduced

Junior lien creditors agree not to object to the senior lien creditors seeking an allowed claim for post-petition interest (not taking into account the junior lien creditors liens or claims on the collateral), and the senior lien creditors agree not to object to the junior lien creditors seeking an allowed claim for post-petition interest (but this time taking into account the senior lien creditors liens or claims on the collateral)

> ... if it is held that the claims of the holders of Priority Payment Lien Obligations and the claims of the other Secured Parties with respect to the other Obligations in respect of the Collateral constitute only one class of secured claims (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims in the manner provided herein), then the holders of Priority Payment Lien Obligations shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them from, or in respect of, the Collateral in respect of principal, pre-petition interest, and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, costs, expenses, premiums, and other charges with respect to the Priority Payment Lien Obligations, irrespective of whether a claim for such amounts is allowed or allowable in such proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any Bankruptcy Law, before any distribution from, or in respect of, any Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the other Secured Parties, with such other Secured Parties hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the holders of Priority Payment Lien Obligations any amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of such Secured Parties.

| Scenario | 1L | 2L |
|----------|----|----|
| Normal Case | Oversecured; entitled to post-petition interest, fees and expenses | Undersecured; not entitled to post-petition interest, fees and expenses, except pursuant to ICA |
| ICA Case | Undersecured; will receive proceeds of collateral only after all senior lien claims are paid in full out of proceeds | Under ICA, will turn over proceeds received until senior lien claims (including post-petition interest, fees and expenses) are paid in full; the amount turned over to the senior lien creditor represents junior lien claims satisfied by the loan parties |

### Rights as Unsecured Creditors

Junior secured creditors often seek to have at least the same rights as they would as unsecured creditors

While attractive in theory (and consistent with the general notion that junior secured creditors are higher in the capital structure ranking than unsecured creditors), this concept led to unintended consequences in the case **In re MPM Silicones, LLC** (2nd Cir. 20) (aka **Momentive** case)

In senior lien/junior lien ICAs, junior lien creditors pre-agree to various limitations on their rights as creditors in bankruptcy

These limitations should not be overridden by general language that gives junior lien creditors all the rights of unsecured creditors

Search for language to the following effect:
> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this intercreditor agreement, the Junior Lien Creditors may exercise rights and remedies as an unsecured creditor.

Use the following language instead:
> Except as otherwise prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the other provisions of this intercreditor agreement, including, without limitation, Sections [ ] [specifying provisions expressly prohibiting, limiting, or restricting certain actions or objections by the Junior Lien Creditors], the Junior Lien Creditors may exercise rights and remedies as an unsecured creditor.

## INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT BASICS

### Parties to the Intercreditor Agreement

Representative for each existing class of creditors:
- For a credit agreement, typically the collateral agent
- For an indenture, typically the trustee acting as collateral trustee

Many ICAs permit the concept of additional representatives being added as parties after the ICA becomes effective

Borrower and all guarantors: typically they are party for certain purposes under the ICA (acknowledging the validity of the agreement among the creditor parties, etc.)
- If any person is added as a loan party, such person is typically required to join the ICA

### Negotiating the Intercreditor Agreement

Is representing the 1L or the 2L (or both), or the ABL lender or the non-ABL lender (or both), and if we represent both, are we trying to be neutral or favor either party?
- In general, our clients favor the ICA leaning toward the benefit of the 1L (in the case of 1L/2L), the ABL (in the case of ABL/non-ABL) and the credit facility (in the case of 1L pari passu between credit agreement and bonds)
- However, the ICA must be acceptable to the other parties and generally consistent with market practices

Our position on the ultimate outcome of the issues related to the questions below could vary depending on whom represents and our objective

In deals where the junior tranche will be held by a single lender or small group of lenders, the junior creditors will likely engage their own counsel to negotiate with the senior creditors
- In such case, the ICA will likely be more protective of the junior creditors and provide less flexibility to the senior creditors
- Atypical provisions should be expressly discussed with the **1L** agent, as they negatively affect **1L** lenders and may affect syndication of the **1L** facility, as well as our clients credit position

The loan parties will typically focus on certain provisions that affect the loan parties such as the releases of assets, DIP cap, and limitations on amendments of **1L/2L** loan documents

## FIRST LIEN I SECOND LIEN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS

### Standard Provisions

2L creditors agree that their liens are subordinated to the liens of the **1L** creditors, regardless of the timing/manner of filing or any defects

Each 1L and 2L creditor agrees not to contest each others liens or allowability of the others claims

Debtor will not grant liens for the 2L against any asset unless it has granted, or will concurrently grant, liens for the **1L** against such asset

**Shared collateral excludes cash collateral** for letter of credit obligations or for defaulting lender obligations

Creditors acknowledge and identify the senior creditor(s), address the lien priority among the creditors, and specify which party:
- has control over the management and sale of the shared collateral and
- can exercise remedies with respect thereto
- Provisions addressing these topics may already exist in each creditor groups respective security agreement and reconciling them is vital

1L representative agrees to act as **bailee for possessory/control collateral** so that 2L creditors may be perfected in such collateral

1L representative has sole right to adjust settlement for an insurance policy covering shared collateral and to approval any award in any condemnation or similar proceeding affecting shared collateral

1L rights survive until **Discharge of First Lien Obligations**

Make sure this definition includes payment of all outstanding obligations (principal, interest, fees, expenses and (to the extent claimed) indemnities, termination of commitments and termination/expiration of all letters of credit (or other arrangements satisfactory to the issuing banks having been made with respect to outstanding letters of credit, such as cash collateralization or back-to-back letters of credit)

### Customary Bankruptcy Provisions

2L creditors cannot use their junior liens to interfere with how the 1L creditors want the case to proceed or how the 1L creditors want to deal with the collateral, including with respect to any DIP financing/cash collateral use and Bankruptcy Code Section 363 sales or other dispositions

2L creditors cannot seek relief from the automatic stay or object to the 1L creditors seeking relief from the automatic stay with respect to the collateral

2L creditors waive their rights to object to the 1L creditors making an election under Bankruptcy Code Section 1111(b) to opt out of having any deficiency claim be treated as an unsecured claim (and instead keeping a full secured claim over the collateral, even when its value may be less than such claim)

There are limited situations when a secured creditor might do so, including when it believes its collateral is temporarily undervalued or being unfairly treated under a plan, and it typically comes up in cases involving relatively limited items of collateral (like single asset real estate bankruptcies)

2L creditors will not support any efforts to surcharge the 1L creditors collateral for the maintenance of such collateral under Bankruptcy Code Section 506(c)
- In situations where a secured creditor has not agreed to cover the expenses of maintaining or disposing of its collateral in a bankruptcy case, a debtor may seek to surcharge the 1L creditors for those expenses and the 2L will in the ICA waive any right to support these efforts

## Intercreditor Agreements, Part II

### Review

This presentation builds on the Academy presentation Intercreditor Agreements, Part I, which covered:

- Purpose and common types of intercreditor agreements
- Important bankruptcy concepts
- Intercreditor agreement basics
- First lien / second lien intercreditor agreements
- Standard provisions

### Intercreditor Agreements Overview

This presentation will cover:

- Business points in first lien / second lien intercreditor agreements
- First lien debt cap
- Standstill period
- DIP financing cap
- Automatic release of liens
- Purchase option
- Amendments to **1L/2L** loan documents
- Customary bankruptcy provisions in first lien / second lien intercreditor agreements
- Crossing lien intercreditor agreements

## Business Points in 1L/2L ICAs CAP ON FIRST LIEN OBLIGATIONS

**1L** obligations will be paid out first with proceeds of collateral, so 2L creditors would like the 1L to be capped

Common approach is for definition of First Lien Obligations or First Lien Cap to cap the total principal amount of 1L obligations under the ICA, either by:
- cross-referencing to the 1L capacity (which would include incremental capacity) permitted under the 2L debt agreement (in this case, the 2L debt agreement should not be permitted to be amended to reduce the 1L capacity after the effective date)
- duplicating the 1L capacity permitted under the 2L debt agreement, including by reference to the specific baskets in the 2L debt agreement

> **First Lien Cap** means, as of any date of determination, the result of:
> (a) the sum of (which amount shall be increased by the amount of all interest and fees, costs, expenses, indemnities, and other amounts accrued or charged with respect to any of the First Lien Debt (other than Excess First Lien Debt) to the extent capitalized and added to the principal amount of the First Lien Debt and including the same as would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, and whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable, in whole or in part, in any such Insolvency Proceeding):
> 
> (i) the sum of (A) $4,950,000, plus (B) 111.5% of the additional principal amount of any Incremental Term Loans (as such term is defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof) actually funded and the additional amount of any Incremental Revolving Commitments (as such term is defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof) actually made, in each case, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.9.4 of the First Lien Credit Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof and without giving effect to any waiver, modification or amendment of any conditions set forth therein (other than modifications and waivers of minimum amounts, notices and other terms of an administrative nature)), plus
> 
> (ii) during an Insolvency Proceeding, the First Lien DIP Amount, plus
> 
> (iii) the aggregate outstanding amount of Secured Hedging Obligations in an aggregate amount under this subclause (iii) not to exceed $2,000,000,

> minus
> 
> (b) the sum of:
> (i) the aggregate amount of all payments of the principal of the term loan obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement or any First Lien Debt under any DIP Financing (other than payments of such term loan obligations in connection with a Refinancing thereof not prohibited by Section 5.3 hereof), plus
> 
> (ii) the amount of all permanent reductions of the revolving credit commitments under the First Lien Credit Agreement or DIP Financing, in each case, to the extent accompanied by any required repayment of principal of revolving loan obligations outstanding under such reduced revolving commitments (other than (x) in connection with a Refinancing of the revolving loan obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement not prohibited by Section 5.3 hereof and (y) any permanent reductions of such revolving credit commitments automatically resulting from the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding).

Alternatively, the ICA does not have a cap on **1L** debt, in which case the 2L would be relying on the limitation on 1L debt in the 2L debt agreement
- The 2L creditors would have a contract claim against the borrower if the borrower borrowed 1L debt in excess of the amount permitted under the 2L debt agreement
- 1L lenders would still have the benefit of the debt being treated as 1L obligations under the ICA, so 2L creditors resist this approach

The cap on 1L obligations usually limits only the principal amount of 1L loans and reimbursement obligations on drawn letters of credit (it usually does not apply to interest, fees, indemnities, expenses, etc. or hedging or cash management obligations)
- Limit on 1L debt (including any cushion over closing date amount + incremental capacity in the 1L credit agreement) is generally negotiated within the 2L credit agreement

## STANDSTILL PERIOD

Prior to the discharge of the 1L obligations, 2L representative agrees not to take any of the following actions until the standstill period end date:
- commence any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding against any loan party
- exercise remedies against the shared collateral
- object to any action, or forbearance from action, by the 1L representative

The standstill period is a negotiated period that can be indefinite (which used to be more common in bank/bond deals and in certain sponsor deals or forms) or varies from 90-18days, and market convention depends on the types of financings involved (loan/bond, loan/loan, loan/mezzanine)
- 18days in the most common standstill period in 1L bank / 2L bond transactions
- For loan/loan transactions, the standstill period is typically 0-18days

**Standstill period commences** after the 2L representative gives notice to the 1L representative that the 2L obligations have become due and payable (whether as a result of acceleration after an event of default or otherwise)

**Standstill period is stayed if:**
- the **1L** representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the shared collateral
- any loan party is subject to a bankruptcy proceeding
- acceleration of the 2L obligations is rescinded

**Exceptions to the standstill:** The 2L representative is permitted to take certain actions specified in the ICA, such as the following (subject to limitations specified):
- filing proofs of claim in bankruptcy
- perfect and protect (but not enforce) liens on its collateral
- vote on a plan of reorganization or liquidation
- filing a response to any objection to its claims or liens

In some 2L favorable club deals, the 2L push for standstill period to commence upon the 2L giving notice to the **1L** of an event of default under the 2L documents and not upon acceleration of the 2L obligations; the **1L** would seek to limit this to significant EODs such as payment event of default and bankruptcy event of default, if not able to negotiate for acceleration

> **Second Priority Enforcement Date** means, with respect to any Second Priority Representative, the date that is consecutive days (through which 0-day period such Second Priority Representative was the Major Second Priority Representative) after the earlier to occur of (a) the Designated Senior Priority Representatives and each other Representatives receipt of written notice from the Major Second Priority Representative that such Second Priority Representative is the Major Second Priority Representative and that a Specified Event of Default (under and as defined in the Second Priority Debt Document for which such Second Priority Representative has been named as Representative) has occurred and is continuing and (b) the date the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations has occurred...

> **Specified Event of Default** means an Event of Default under Sections of the Second Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the date hereof (and the corresponding provisions of any Second Priority Debt Document) [to include payment and bankruptcy events of default].

## DIP FINANCING

Debtor-in-possession financing is debt financing provided to the debtor to finance its operations during the course of the bankruptcy case

**DIP** financing is typically afforded the highest priority (i.e., it primes all existing secured debt), so often the existing **1L** secured lenders want to provide the **DIP** financing to avoid being primed by others and to retain the predominant position among creditors (and thereby control how the case progresses)

## DIP FINANCING

The ICA seeks to ensure that the 2L creditors cannot leverage their liens to gain undue benefits by threatening a priming battle or otherwise depriving the debtor of needed new loans at the onset of the case if the 1L creditors support a proposed **DIP** financing
- 2L creditors agree not to object to any DIP financing or use of cash collateral to which the **1L** creditors have consented or not objected (although 2L creditors may try to retain some limited objection rights)

To the extent the 1L creditors have agreed to be primed, the 2L creditors also expressly agree to be primed by the **DIP** liens, any adequate protection liens granted to the **1L** creditors, and any carve out for professional and bankruptcy trustee fees agreed to by the **1L** agent, so to avoid a priming battle with the 2L creditors

Business issue is whether the amount of DIP financing that is pre-consented to by the 2L creditors is capped, and if so, the amount of the cap
- A **DIP cap** provides some basic protection for the 2L creditors, to ensure they will have not agreed ahead of time to be subordinated to a potentially much higher amount than initially contemplated through a new priming DIP financing, and is often a means of making a deal more attractive to potential 2L participants

Borrowers resist caps because it limits their flexibility, and argue that the 2L should not interfere in determining the appropriate size of the DIP financing, which has to be approved by the bankruptcy court anyway

The rule of thumb is that the smaller the amount of the transaction, the more likely the ICA will include a DIP cap, such that a club deal will typically include one but it would likely only be present in about half of larger syndicated deals where the 2L is bank debt

A DIP cap is also less prevalent in bank/bond structure

In deals with caps, a typical cap is 10-20% of the total amount of either the maximum permitted amount of 1L debt under the existing 1L debt agreement (which is more **1L** favorable) or the amount of 1L debt outstanding on the petition date (more 2L favorable); the latter is slightly more common

Any pre-petition 1L debt that is rolled up into the DIP (i.e., effectively elevated to having the same priming status as the rest of the new DIP loan, despite the fact that it is existing pre-petition debt) is counted against the cap amount

Also note that the DIP cap should never be the same amount as the 1L debt cap, because if the borrower had drawn the full amount of the 1L debt cap as of the bankruptcy petition date, then the 2L could object to any amount of new money coming in as a DIP loan (i.e., the DIP cap would effectively be $0)

Note that a DIP cap does not prevent the debtor from seeking DIP financing in an amount that exceeds the DIP cap; however, 2L creditors would not be precluded from objecting to DIP financing in excess of the cap

In some recent 2L favorable ICAs, the 2L negotiated for the right to object to a proposed DIP financing if the DIP financing sets forth specific terms for a plan of reorganization or requires any dispositions of shared collateral prior to a default

> **Financing Issues.** Until the Discharge of Senior Obligations has occurred, if the Borrower or any other Grantor shall be subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and any Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party shall desire to consent (or not object) to the sale, use or lease of cash or other collateral or to consent (or not object) to the Borrowers or any other Grantors obtaining financing under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other Bankruptcy Law (**DIP Financing**), then each Junior Priority Representative ... agrees that it will raise no objection to and will not otherwise contest ... such DIP Financing, unless each Senior Representative shall oppose or object to such DIP Financing ...

> provided that (1) the amount of such DIP Financing, together with the aggregate principal and stated amount of loans and unreimbursed letter of credit obligations outstanding under the Senior Debt Documents, does not exceed 1% of the amount of Senior Obligations outstanding and/or committed upon the date of the commencement of such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding ... (3) such DIP Financing or proposed cash collateral use does not compel any Grantor to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization for which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the documentation or order relating to such DIP Financing or proposed cash collateral use, and (4) such DIP Financing or proposed cash collateral use does not expressly require the sale, liquidation or disposition of all or any substantial part of the Shared Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing or cash collateral order.

**Q: When should the 2nd lien security interests be released on an asset?**

1. When the asset is released from the 1st lien security interests
2. When the 1st lien forecloses on the asset
3. Only if the sale is permitted by the 2nd lien credit agreement

**A: When should the 2nd lien security interests be released on an asset?**

1. When the asset is released from the 1st lien security interests: **2nd lien may object to this broad formulation though**
2. When the 1st lien forecloses on the asset: **1st lien agent should generally have freedom to exercise remedies against collateral**
3. Only if the sale is permitted by the 2nd lien credit agreement: **Release should be permitted even if the disposition is not permitted by the 2nd lien credit agreement in the case of foreclosure**

## AUTOMATIC RELEASE OF LIENS

Two common approaches:

**More 2L favorable:** Lien securing the 2L facility on any asset automatically released only (i) if such sale is also permitted by (or not prohibited by) the 2L loan documents or (ii) in connection with an enforcement of remedies by the **1L** agent

**Less 2L favorable:** Lien securing the 2L facility on any asset automatically released if the **1L** agent releases the lien on such asset, unless such release is in connection with the payment in full of the **1L** obligations not resulting from the exercise of remedies by the 1L lenders

Some intercreditor agreements will also provide that if the equity interests of a subsidiary are sold, then the guarantee given by such subsidiary under the 2L will be released automatically if the 1L agent releases the guarantee given by such subsidiary

In 2L favorable club deals, the release provision will be heavily negotiated; the following are examples of some requests made by the 2L:
- That proceeds of the sale of the assets that are released must be applied in accordance with the waterfall; this provision is acceptable to the 1L
- That the 2L retains a lien on proceeds of the sale of the released collateral that remain after application to the 1L; this provision is acceptable to the 1L
- Restrictions on asset dispositions to a subsidiary or affiliate of the borrower or to the sponsor; this is generally acceptable to the 1L, with exception for public sale process/sale approved by the bankruptcy court
- Liens of 2L will be released in connection with a sale only if the sale is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner; this should not be acceptable to the 1L as this claim can always be made and jeopardize the foreclosure on collateral by the 1L
- Liens of the 2L will be released only if the 2L receives prior notice of the sale of the asset; this is very controversial to the 1L

## PURCHASE OPTION

Typically gives the 2L creditors the right to purchase the **1L** creditors debt at par, plus accrued interest and expenses, within 3days of the acceleration of the **1L** creditors debt or the commencement of a bankruptcy case

Generally not controversial except for the points below:
- If prepayment of the **1L** would be subject to a prepayment premium, whether the 2L would have to pay the **1L** such premium if the purchase option is exercised
- If the ICA contains a **1L** debt cap but the **1L** creditors lent in excess of the cap, whether the 2L creditors would have to purchase only up to the amount of that cap or would also have to purchase any outstanding **1L** debt above it
- In some recent 2L favorable ICAs, the 2L negotiated for expanded triggers for the purchase option, including any exercise of remedies by the **1L** agent or an event of default under the **1L** documents or the 2L documents

> Without prejudice to the enforcement of the Senior Priority Secured Partie remedies, the Senior Priority Secured Parties agree that following the occurrence of any of (a) the acceleration of the Senior Priority Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Senior Priority Debt Documents, (b) the commencement of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (c) any principal or interest payment-related Event of Default under either the Senior Priority Debt Documents or the Second Priority Debt Documents that remains uncured and is continuing for a period of 3days, (d) the commencement of the exercise of remedies with respect to a material portion of the Shared Collateral by the Designated Senior Priority Representative, or (e) the Disposition of any specified item of Shared Collateral by any Grantor that occurs with the consent of the Designated Senior Priority Representative following the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default under the Senior Priority Debt Documents that results in the release of the Senior Secured Partie Lien thereon (each, a Purchase Event), within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of any Purchase Event, one or more of the Second Priority Secured Parties may request, and the Senior Priority Secured Parties hereby offer the Second Priority Secured Parties the option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Priority Obligations outstanding at the time of purchase in accordance with the terms of the applicable Senior Priority Debt Documents at par, plus any premium that would be applicable upon prepayment of the Senior Priority Obligations and accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and expenses ...

## AMENDMENTS TO 1L/2L LOAN DOCUMENTS

**Security documents:** Generally, any amendments to the 1L security documents are automatically incorporated into the 2L security documents (drag-along), subject to limited exceptions (e.g., if collateral for the 2L is removed and agent protections)

In some recent 2L favorable deals, the 2L have sought for the removal of the drag-along provision; this reduces flexibility for the 1L and the loan parties, and we should seek to keep

These provisions are not typical for crossing lien intercreditor agreements discussed at the end of this presentation

**Other loan documents:** Generally neither 1L nor 2L loan documents may be amended in a way that would contravene the intercreditor agreement

In some 2L favorable deals, the parties also agree to certain limitations on the ability to amend 2L and/or 1L loan documents (for example, not to increase the interest rate/yield beyond a cushion or shorten maturity)

> ... any such amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or Refinancing of the First Lien Documents shall not, without the consent of the Directing Senior Second Lien Security Agent:
> i. shorten or have the effect of shortening the Weighted Average Life to Maturity (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) or the scheduled final maturity date of any principal amount of First Lien Obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement or a Refinancing thereof or any other First Lien Document or a Refinancing thereof other than for administrative reasons;
> ii. change or add any covenant or event of default (other than maturity, fees, discounts, interest rate, redemption terms and redemption premiums) in the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other First Lien Document (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof) in a manner that is more materially restrictive to the Loan Parties (as determined in good faith by the Borrower) when taken as a whole with the corresponding terms of the Second Lien Obligations unless (1) the Second Lien Lenders receive the benefit of such more restrictive terms or (2) any such provisions apply after the Latest Maturity Date (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement); ...
> iii. add any limitation on the optional or mandatory prepayment of the loans under the Second Lien Loan Agreements or any other Second Lien Document (including interest or other amounts payable thereunder);
> iv. amend, waive or consent to any variations of, or otherwise modify the provisions relating to restrictions and prohibitions on assignments or sales of the First Lien Obligations to any Grantor or any Affiliate of a Grantor; or
> v. increase the default rate of interest (provided, that to cause all outstanding First Lien Obligations (rather than only overdue amounts) to accrue interest at the default rate upon an event of default shall not be deemed an increase).

### Customary Bankruptcy Provisions

2L creditors cannot use their junior liens to interfere with how the 1L creditors want the case to proceed or how the 1L creditors want to deal with the collateral, including with respect to any DIP financing/cash collateral use and Bankruptcy Code Section 363 sales or other dispositions

2L creditors cannot seek relief from the automatic stay or object to the 1L creditors seeking relief from the automatic stay with respect to the collateral

2L creditors waive their rights to object to the 1L creditors making an election under Bankruptcy Code Section 1111(b) to opt out of having any deficiency claim be treated as an unsecured claim (and instead keeping a full secured claim over the collateral, even when its value may be less than such claim)
- There are limited situations when a secured creditor might do so, including when it believes its collateral is temporarily undervalued or being unfairly treated under a plan, and it typically comes up in cases involving relatively limited items of collateral (like single asset real estate bankruptcies)

2L creditors will not support any efforts to surcharge the 1L creditors collateral for the maintenance of such collateral under Bankruptcy Code Section 506(c)
- In situations where a secured creditor has not agreed to cover the expenses of maintaining or disposing of its collateral in a bankruptcy case, a debtor may seek to surcharge the 1L creditors for those expenses and the 2L will in the ICA waive any right to support these efforts

## OTHER TYPES OF INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS

### Crossing Lien Intercreditor Agreements

**Mutuality:** ABL creditors have rights of 1L creditors with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral and the cash flow creditors have rights of 2L creditors with respect thereto, and vice versa with respect to the Cash Flow Priority Collateral

Issues discussed above related to 1L/2L ICAs generally apply, except that, given the mutuality, in general neither side pushes for terms that are overly favorable to the ABL or cash flow side

Where the structure is ABL/notes (instead of ABL/term loan), the ABL side may have greater rights overall

**Description of ABL Priority Collateral and Fixed Asset Priority Collateral:** The respective definitions of priority collateral are important in crossing lien transactions and reflect issues that may need to be confirmed with the client, such as who is entitled to business interruption proceeds and intercompany debt or any other debt (including the proceeds of ABL loans) as their priority collateral

**DIP Financing**

Each side typically agrees not to object to a DIP financing that has been consented to by the other agent that would prime such consenting agents own priority collateral, as long as such DIP did not also prime the priority collateral of the first side without its consent

If each side offers to provide a **DIP** that meet the various conditions, then the debtor could then choose which one to accept

## OTHER TYPES OF INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS

### Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreements

With certain exceptions, when it comes to the priority of liens, the rule is first in time, first in right

An initial perfected lien will generally have priority over all subsequent liens of the same type

In a pari passu intercreditor agreement, creditors with differing priority liens **contractually** agree to override the first in time, first in right rule

Waterfall provisions specify that creditors will share proceeds of shared collateral on a **pari passu** basis, regardless of timing of grant or perfection of security interests to the extent such creditors have a valid and perfected lien on such shared collateral

If the borrower has existing debt and proposes to incur new **pari passu** secured debt, the existing debt documents must be reviewed to determine whether a **pari passu** intercreditor agreement is permitted:

- The existing debt documents must permit the proposed new debt to be secured on a **pari passu** basis with the existing first lien obligations; and
- The existing debt documents must authorize the representative of the holders of the existing debt (e.g., the collateral agent under a credit agreement or a collateral trustee under an indenture) to enter into the **pari passu** intercreditor agreement

> The Lenders and the other Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to, without any further consent of any Lender or any other Secured Party, enter into (or acknowledge and consent to) or amend, renew, extend, supplement, restate, replace, waive or otherwise modify any First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any other Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement, any other Permitted Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement with the collateral agent or other representatives of the holders of Indebtedness that is to be secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is not prohibited (including with respect to priority) under this Agreement and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof (any of the foregoing, an **Intercreditor Agreement**).

### Liens Baskets Expressly Permitting the Incurrence of Pari Passu First Liens

> (hh) Liens, including Liens on the Collateral that are Other First Liens, so long as immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of the Indebtedness secured by such Liens and the use of proceeds thereof, the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio on a Pro Forma Basis is not greater than 4.0to 1.00;...

> **Other First Liens** shall mean Liens on the Collateral that rank pari passu with the Liens thereon securing the Term B Loans (and other Loan Obligations that are secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank pari passu with the Liens thereon securing the Term B Loans) pursuant to a Permitted Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

> **Permitted Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement** shall mean, with respect to any Liens on the Collateral that are intended to rank pari passu with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans (and other Loan Obligations that are secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank pari passu with the Liens thereon securing the Term B Loans), either (as the Borrower shall elect) (x) the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (y) another intercreditor agreement not materially less favorable to the Lenders vis--vis such pan passu Liens than the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement is to the Lenders (as determined by the Borrower in good faith) or (z) another intercreditor agreement the terms of which are consistent with market terms governing security arrangements for the sharing of liens on a pari passu basis at the time such intercreditor agreement is proposed to be established in light of the type of Indebtedness to be secured by such liens, as determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in the exercise of reasonable judgment.

### GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS

May be among senior lien pari passu creditors or among junior (second lien) pari passu lien creditors

Much shorter document; does not have detailed bankruptcy provisions except as described below

Does not specify a limit on the amount of obligations that are subject to the ICA (unlike the debt cap in 1L/2L ICAs)

Parties agree not to contest lien of any other creditor party to the ICA

### CONTROLLING AGENT

Controls remedies (as if it had the senior and exclusive lien on the shared collateral) and makes other determinations, such as whether to object to DIP financing

Business issue is **who is the Controlling Agent, and who directs the Controlling Agent;** the relative sizes of the tranches will be important for this determination

Options include:

- Common in bank/bond deals: **Controlling Agent is the administrative agent for the credit agreement until the credit agreement is discharged in full, subject to the standstill, then the Controlling Agent is the representative for the tranche with the greatest principal amount/commitment at such time**
- Controlling Agent is a designated entity that is directed by the majority in aggregate principal amount/commitment of all tranches combined that are subject to the ICA
- Controlling Agent is designated at closing and is the representative for the tranche with the greatest principal amount/commitment at closing (and directed by the creditors of that tranche in accordance with the documentation governing that tranche), until such tranche is discharged in full, subject to the standstill, and then Controlling Agent shifts to the representative for another specified tranche

**Impairments**

Each tranche bears the risk (i) of a court determining that the obligations of such tranche are unenforceable or shall be subordinated to other obligations or that such tranches lien is invalid or subordinated to any intervening liens or (ii) that it does not have a valid and perfected lien on assets constituting collateral for a different tranche (e.g., because a UCC lapsed), this being referred to as an impairment

If there is an impairment with respect to a tranche, the impairment will be borne solely by the creditors of that tranche (and not the other creditors)

The distribution of proceeds to any tranche that is impaired will be reduced to reflect any impairment of its obligations or security interests

**DIP Financing**

Parties pre-agree to not object to DIP financing or use of cash collateral unless the Controlling Agent objects to such DIP financing or cash collateral use

### WATERFALL SECTION

Decision in **Energy Future Holdings** Chapter 11 Cases
- Court analyzed whether under the waterfall provision of the first lien pari passu intercreditor agreement at issue, adequate protection and post-petition interest payments and other related distributions had to be allocated ratably amongst the three tranches of first lien debt

Waterfall provision referred to a ratable distribution of Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies shall be applied

The court held that because the adequate protection and related distributions did not constitute a distribution of collateral upon the exercise of remedies, the waterfall language did not govern these distributions, such that they did not have to be shared ratably among the three tranches

In light of this decision, we have been revising the waterfall and related provisions in pari passu intercreditor agreements to attempt to ensure that all **1L** creditors ratable share of adequate protection and related distributions would be allocated ratably, regardless of (i) what allocation methodology a particular court uses to determine whether a particular **1L** tranche was entitled to adequate protection or other post-petition interest payments and (ii) whether or not one of the different tranches of pari debt has a higher contractual interest rate (for example, a newer **1L** lender brought in later on to try to stave off a bankruptcy)

Add new definition:

> **Post-Petition Interest** means any interest or entitlement to fees or expenses or other charges that accrue after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, whether or not allowed or allowable as a claim in any such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

Revise waterfall provision as follows:

> Anything contained herein or in any of the Secured Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding (but subject to Section 1.03), if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First-Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of any Borrower or any other Grantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First-Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than this Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First-Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First-Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payments, or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) to which the First-Lien Obligations are entitled under any intercreditor agreement (other than this Agreement) (all payments, distributions, and proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Shared Collateral and all proceeds of any such distribution or payment being collectively referred to as Proceeds), shall be applied (i) FIRST, to the payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any Secured Credit Document, (ii) SECOND, subject to Section 1.03, to the payment in full of the First-Lien Obligations of each Series on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First-Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable Secured Credit Documents, provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to any Borrower or any other Grantor, solely as among the holders of First-Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of this clause SECOND and not any Secured Credit Documents, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First-Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First-Lien Obligations of each Series of First-Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First-Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding; and (iii) THIRD, after payment of all First-Lien Obligations, to the Borrowers and the other Grantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

### Superpriority / Last-Out Debt

Provisions granting superpriority (or last-out) status in the waterfall for certain debt can be included in a credit agreement (such as those involving a superpriority revolver) or in a separate intercreditor agreement or agreement amongst lenders where each of the various creditor groups (such as in a bank/bond deal) is granted its own pari passu lien subject to their agreement to give one side priority in payment

The intercreditor agreement will primarily consist of pari passu intercreditor agreement provisions (such as with regard to exercising remedies, the impairment and intervening lien sections, exculpatory provisions, and the automatic release of the pari creditors liens), but will also contain others that are more common in 1L/2L intercreditor agreements

Specifically, the bankruptcy provisions can be more akin to what are in 1L/2L ICAs, but how many of these provisions are included in a particular superpriority ICA will vary depending on the degree to which the priority parties want to silence the non-priority parties

At a minimum (including when the superpriority provisions are done in the credit agreement), the Bankruptcy Code Section 510(a), plan voting, and separate classification sections will typically be included, and more restrictive superpriority ICAs will also include the **DIP,** bankruptcy sale, reorganization securities, and adequate protection provisions

To help protect the superpriority lenders rights to post-petition interest in bankruptcy, we include a turnover provision and provide for separate security documents or separate grants of security interests in the security documents and file separate financing statements, even if we have a single set of security documents and a single collateral agent

### Future 1.5 or 3rd Lien Debt

lntercreditor agreements typically allow for additional debt holders to be added as parties in the future without also requiring a new or amended agreement, or the specific consent of the existing lenders

Parties that satisfy the conditions for being deemed Additional Senior Debt or Additional Junior Debt would execute a joinder to the ICA, and the borrower would provide a certificate indicating that the new debt meets the requirements for joining the ICA and is also permitted under the existing loan documents

A business issue is whether the borrower would want the flexibility to be able to add debt that could slot in between the existing 1L and 2L debt, which is referred to as 1.5 debt, or would fall below the existing 2L debt as a new third lien

Any such flexibility would have to be built into the definitions of Additional Senior Debt or Additional Junior Debt

> **Additional Junior Debt** means any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Grantor (other than Indebtedness constituting Junior Credit Agreement Obligations) guaranteed by the Guarantors (and not guaranteed by any other Person) which Indebtedness and Guarantees are secured by the Junior Collateral (or a portion thereof) [THIS LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW FOR NEW POTENTIAL THIRD LIEN DEBT: on **a pari passe** or junior basis] (but without regard to control of remedies) with the Junior Credit Agreement Obligations (and not secured by Liens on any other assets of the Borrower or any Guarantor); provided, however, that, (i) such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred, secured and guaranteed on such basis by each then extant Senior Debt Document and Junior Debt Document and (ii) the Representative for the holders of such Indebtedness shall have become party to this Agreement pursuant to, and by satisfying the conditions set forth in, Section 8.09 hereof. Additional Junior Debt shall include any Registered Equivalent Notes and Guarantees thereof by the Guarantors issued in exchange therefor.

> **Additional Senior Debt** means any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Grantor (other than Indebtedness constituting Senior Credit Agreement Obligations) guaranteed by the Guarantors (and not guaranteed by any other person) which Indebtedness and Guarantees are secured by the Senior Collateral (or a portion thereof) [THIS LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW FOR NEW POTENTIAL 1.5 LIEN DEBT: on a senior basis to the Junior Obligations] (but without regard to control of remedies) (and not secured by Liens on any other assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary); provided, however, that, (i) such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred, secured and guaranteed on such basis by each then extant Senior Debt Document and Junior Debt Document and (ii) the Representative for the holders of such Indebtedness shall have become party to (A) this Agreement pursuant to, and by satisfying the conditions set forth in, Section 8.09 hereof and (B) the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to, and by satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 5. thereof. Additional Senior Debt shall include any Registered Equivalent Notes and Guarantees thereof by the Guarantors issued in exchange therefor; provided further that, if such Indebtedness will be the initial Additional Senior Debt incurred by the Borrower, then the Guarantors, the Senior Collateral Agent and the Representative for such Indebtedness shall have executed and delivered the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor or a bankruptcy trustee to sell assets free and clear of liens

Typical process is that debtor enters into a stalking horse agreement with a potential buyer, seeks court authorization for certain bidding and related sales procedures, allows other potential buyers to conduct due diligence and eventually hold an auction if other bidders do emerge, and then selects the highest or best offer

In a sale supported by the 1L creditors, there are three potential alternatives regarding the 2L creditors ability to file any objection:

- Are the 2L creditors permitted to assert any objections that could be raised by an unsecured creditor of the borrower to any aspect of the proposed sale?
- Are the 2L creditors permitted to assert an objection that could be asserted by an unsecured creditor only to the proposed bidding and related sale procedures?
- Are the 2L creditors prevented from filing any sale-related objections altogether?

### Plan Voting

Note that the bankruptcy law views creditors voting rights in bankruptcy as fundamental rights that cannot be contracted away, except in a limited manner

For example, a provision that the 2L will align its vote to the 1L vote on a plan of reorganization will likely be ineffective

However, ICA may prohibit (and typically does prohibit) 2L creditors from proposing or voting in favor of a plan of reorganization that is inconsistent with the terms of the intercreditor agreement

**Cramdown Chapter 11 plans**

A debtor may potentially cram down and have the court confirm a plan over the objection of the 1L creditors if another impaired class votes to accept the plan and the **1L** creditors get certain statutory protections (such as retaining their liens and getting deferred cash payments)

Terms of an intercreditor subordination agreement may not be strictly enforced when the court confirms a cramdown plan in Chapter 11. **In re Tribune** Co., 972 F.3d 228, 232, 237 (3d Cir. 2020)
- Worst case scenario for **1L** creditors is that the debtor proposes a cram down plan that would give the **1L** creditors all of the collateral, and then induces the out-of-the-money 2L creditors to vote to approve the plan by offering them some junior security (like common stock in **Momentive,** which the court held did not constitute proceeds of the 1L creditors collateral, and therefore offering it to the 2L creditors did not violate the intercreditor agreement)

To address this issue, the intercreditor agreement can specifically prohibit the 2L creditors from voting in favor of a plan that either does not provide for the payment in full in cash of all **1L** obligations or that was not approved by the **1L** creditors in accordance with the voting rules under the Bankruptcy Code, which is 2/3 in amount and 1/2 in number of claims in a class voting to approve the plan

### Adequate Protection

Bankruptcy Code requires that secured creditors receive adequate protection of their security interests to allow the debtor to continue to use the collateral post-petition

Typical provision is that if the 1L creditors get adequate protection in the form of liens on replacement or additional collateral, or a superpriority claim, then the 2L creditors may also obtain a junior lien or a junior claim as adequate protection

When representing the 2L creditors, also want to ensure that they may at least seek (if not also retain) adequate protection in the form of cash payments for post-petition fees and expenses to the extent the 1L creditors are also allowed these
- First lien creditors may demand that any such payments be subject to some monthly or quarterly cap or a budget agreed to by the 1L creditors

In Crossing Lien ICAs, cash flow creditors are free to seek adequate protection in any form for Cash Flow Priority Collateral (other than cash payments from the proceeds of the ABL Priority Collateral) and junior liens and claims as adequate protection for its 2L on the ABL Priority Collateral, and vice versa

## PAYMENT SUBORDINATED DEBT

### Subordinated Debt Generally

This section will address contractual payment subordination (as opposed to lien subordination or subordination of distribution in collateral proceeds)

We generally do not see subordinated debt in todays market, except for:
- mezzanine debt (typically not syndicated)
- seller paper (when the seller of an asset agrees to take a note from the buyer as part of the consideration)
- investments by shareholders (sometimes in lieu of equity infusions)
- intercompany debt
- sponsor management fee obligations

When we are representing the mezzanine lender, we look to protect the subordinated creditor interests; otherwise we are looking to protect the senior creditors

### Senior Indebtedness

In a subordination agreement, subordinated creditors agree to **turnover** to the holders of Senior Indebtedness whatever recoveries the subordinated creditors would otherwise be entitled to in an enforcement scenario (including bankruptcy proceeding) until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full

**Senior Indebtedness** typically includes the **principal of, premium, if any, and interest (usually including post-petition interest)** on all debt for money borrowed, unless the agreement under which such other debt for money borrowed is incurred expressly provides that it is not senior to junior debt

Senior Indebtedness also typically includes all charges, fees and expenses (including indemnities) in connection with the incurrence of Senior Debt

Senior Indebtedness generally excludes trade payables, debt owed to subsidiaries, tax obligations and certain other items

Senior Indebtedness definition may be heavily negotiated because the subordinated lender will want to limit the total amount of debt to which it is subordinated

It is not uncommon in mezzanine financings for the amount of Senior Indebtedness to be limited to the amount outstanding or committed at closing plus a 10-% cushion plus any incremental indebtedness incurred pursuant to the terms of the Senior Indebtedness as in effect on the closing date plus the same cushion, in each case reduced by prepayments and permanent commitment reductions

### Payment Blockage

In addition to turnover in an enforcement scenario, senior creditors generally want to limit payments in respect of subordinated debt until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full

**Prior to an event of default** under Senior Indebtedness:
- **Deeply subordinated paper:** Subordination provisions will generally provide that no payments of [principal] [principal and cash interest] may be made until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full
- **Mezzanine debt:** Typically regularly scheduled payments of interest are permitted; optional prepayments of principal may be permitted subject to satisfying a restricted payments or restricted debt payments covenant

**During a payment event of default** under Senior Indebtedness

Typically, no payments (whether principal or interest) are permitted in respect of subordinated debt if a payment event of default exists under such Senior Indebtedness (most typically without any requirement to deliver notice to the holders of subordinated debt of the existence of such payment event of default)

This may cause a default under the subordinated debt document, but the subordinated debt holders typically agree to an **enforcement standstill** agreeing not to exercise remedies until the earlier of a fixed period (typically 120/18days) or if the Senior Indebtedness is accelerated or if a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced
- The primary purpose for the **enforcement standstill** is to provide the senior creditors a period of time to address with the borrower and other creditors solutions to existing defaults

**During a non-payment event of default** under Senior Indebtedness

Typically, no payments (whether principal or interest) are permitted in respect of subordinated debt **for a period of up to 179 days** (the **blockage period,** or fish or cut bait provision) if a representative of Designated Senior Indebtedness has given notice to the subordinated holders that an event of default exists under such Senior Indebtedness

Before the blockage period ends, the Designated Senior Indebtedness representative must decide whether to take action against the breach (typically accelerating maturity) or permit the resumption of payments of junior obligations in spite of the continued existence of the breach

Designated Senior Indebtedness typically includes a bank credit facility and any other significant debt obligation

**Typical limitations on blockage notices**
- No more than one notice with respect to a particular breach
- No more than one notice in a specified period (usually a one-year period) thus assuring that there will be a window in such period during which payments can be made

Since senior creditors often require a wide variety of covenants and other duties in connection with their obligations, they are quite often in a position to block payments to junior creditors

However, a blockage produces a payment breach of the junior creditors obligations, subject to the passage of any remedies standstill period, allowing them to accelerate the maturity of such obligations

A junior creditors ability to threaten acceleration (as well as the ability of other creditors to accelerate because of cross-defaults arising from the payment blockage), with the possible or probable result of bankruptcy, is an important check on senior creditors, who in practice are often reluctant to impose a blockage

In non-marketed debt like seller paper, non-payment events of default may be treated the same as payment events of default (indefinite blockage during any event of default)

Any prohibited payments received by subordinated debt holders during a payment event of default under Senior Indebtedness, the blockage period or following acceleration of Senior Indebtedness must be turned over to the Senior Indebtedness holders

Some credit agreements require that **intercompany debt** be evidenced by a global intercompany note that contains subordination provisions
- If the payee is a loan party (unless the payor is the borrower), we **do not** want payments to be blocked at any time
- If the payor is a loan party and the payee is a non-loan party, we **do** want payments to be blocked during an event of default under the credit agreement

### Subrogation

Subrogation allows the subordinated lender to step into the shoes of the senior lender once the senior lender has been paid

If the senior lender received a portion of a distribution to which the subordinated lender would have been entitled, the subordinated lender will be subrogated to that amount
- the subrogated lender would be able to afford itself of all the rights of the senior lender

This is different from a junior secured lender that turns over all or a portion of its recoveries to a senior secured lender that was undersecured

### Effect of Subordination in a U.S. Bankruptcy

Subordination agreements are generally respected in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings

In practice, junior creditors can possess significant leverage in such proceedings, since they will normally have the right to vote, as a class, to approve any bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation and to be heard on a variety of other issues that may arise, such as valuation of the borrowers assets

Consequently, junior creditors can attempt to block or delay the implementation of measures to repay creditors from the debtors assets

Senior creditors, faced with the prospect of a lengthy delay in receiving repayments, sometimes agree to allow junior creditors a share of the repayment in return for their approval, even where senior creditors do not receive full payment for their claims

## PRACTICE POINTS

### Practice Points

Review or prepare drafts using (or against) appropriate precedents and tailor to transaction
- Be mindful of whom we are representing and the relative sizes of the tranches

Read and seek to understand all provisions in the agreement

Consult with our bankruptcy and UCC specialists, but note that they are reviewing for their specialist areas and not on corporate matters

Check against any agreed business terms in the term sheet (if any)

Identify business points and seek direction from client, providing appropriate context and survey of precedents
- flag unusual provisions or comments

If there are foreign loan parties, consult with local counsel; intercreditor agreements in non-U.S. jurisdictions may not be respected or may have very different structures

Check defined terms and cross references carefully, including those to other documents

Check name of client globally as well as other parties, and check that the notice information for the client is correct

Conform boilerplate (e.g., governing law, jurisdiction, e-signature) to the credit agreement if possible
